The indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO2 emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing value added (MVA).                CO2 emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of CO2 per USD constant 2010 PPP GDP. CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are measured in kilogrammes of CO2 equivalent per unit of MVA in constant 2015 USD. Total CO2 emissions Total CO2 emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy consumption data for all sectors.CO2 emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by industry is not included here but reported under transport):- Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];- Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;- Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];- Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];- Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];- Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];- Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];- Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];- Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper)  [ISIC Division 16];- Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];- Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics). CO2 emissions need to be estimated based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies (IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories). The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed energy statistics definitions and estimates CO2 emissions based on the IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories Tier 1 methodology, producing internationally comparable CO2 emissions data for over 150 countries and regions. Gross value added (GVA) The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units' total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the total CO2 emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015. CO2 emissions from fuel combustion are estimated based on energy consumption and on the IPCC Guidelines.The total intensity of the economy is defined as the ratio of total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and GDP.The sectoral intensity is defined as CO2 emission from manufacturing (in physical measurement unit such as tonnes) divided by manufacturing value added (MVA) in constant 2015 USD.CO2 emissions per unit of value added = CO2 emission from manufacturing (in kg) / MVA (constant USD) Estimation of CO2 emission data is not systematized in many countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include statistical offices, Energy Ministries, Environment agencies, among others. Energy consumption data and value added data are coming from different data sources which may raise some consistency issues. The indicator CO2 emissions per unit of value added represents the amount of emissions from fuel combustion produced by an economic activity, per unit of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, in the structure of the manufacturing sector, in the energy efficiency of production technologies in each sub-sector, and in the economic value of the various output. Manufacturing industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. CO2 emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from the manufacturing processes. Data sources:Data on total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, also disaggregated by sector, are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA) database (IEA CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion:https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-2019).

The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter.     The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016) Urban/rural data: while the data quality available for urban/rural population is generally good for high-income countries, it can be relatively poor for some low- and middle income areas.

It refers to the efforts by countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance.  The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.   The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.     Summation of information made available by each Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity and to the International Treaty related to:ABS legislative, administrative or policy measures made available to the ABS Clearing-House and to the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (y/n) This indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks over time.This indicator does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks. The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules established on access and benefit-sharing. However, it is difficult to have a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative, administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Nagoya Protocol, to be operational, requires that certain enabling conditions are met at the national level for its effective implementation.  In particular, countries will need, depending on their specific circumstances, to revise legislative, administrative or policy measures already in place or develop new measures in order to meet the obligations set out under the Protocol.  In particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by indigenous communities, and benefits arising from the utilization of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same manner. The goal is to allow users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge to easily find information on the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources and knowledge in an organized manner, and all in one convenient location.The International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and procedures with their obligations under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other facilitated access to their plant genetic resources, while users of plant genetic material from the Multilateral System are encouraged to share their benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow to farmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. Pursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and operational mechanism to promote compliance and address issues of non-compliance.  Under the monitoring and reporting in the Procedures, each Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty, including the access and benefit-sharing measures. Contracting Parties report using an agreed standard format and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance. Additionally, information on the number of Standard Material Transfer Agreements is gathered from the Data Store of the International Treaty through Easy-SMTA. SMTA is a mandatory contract that Contracting Parties of the International Treaty have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources falling under the Multilateral System are made available.  Indicator 15.6.1 directly measures progress made by countries in establishing legislative, administrative or policy frameworks on access and benefit-sharing (ABS). By developing their ABS frameworks, countries are contributing to the achievement of SDG Target 15.6 and to the conservation and sustainable use of biological and genetic diversity.

"SDG_ER_H2O_FWTL","Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels (not overexploited) (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels (not overexploited) (%) The indicator, Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels, measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation.MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)). Fish stock Fish stock refers to a group of individuals of a single species or sometimes combined species living in a defined area from which catches are taken in a fishery. Reference list of stock A reference list of stocks should be established by each country and consists of a list of stocks selected according to FAO guidelines, against which the indicator will be reported. The reference list should include national and shared stocks but not straddling stocks as defined below. National stock National stocks are located completely within an EEZ and/or territorial waters.  FAO currently reports the global and regional indicators calculated from FAO’s assessment of a selected list of fish stocks around the world. The methodology is described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO 2011).  FAO has been developing the new approach for country-level reporting since 2017, and has consulted with countries in three dedicated expert consultation workshops: In November 2017, FAO convened a workshop to exchange views with national practitioners on the new proposed analytical methods to produce Indicator 14.4.1 at country level . In February 2019, FAO convened an expert consultation workshop  on development of the methodologies for the global assessment of fish stock status, with participants from countries and regional fisheries organizations. In October 2019, FAO organized a capacity development workshop on stock status assessment and estimation methods of SDG Indicator 14.4.1 for the Asia Pacific Region, with participants from 17 countries. However, so far very few countries have started their own estimation and reporting of Indicator 14.4.1.Global/Regional:Global and regional estimates of stock sustainability have been performed for 584 fish stocks around the world since 1974, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock is estimated using the methodology described in the FAO Technical Paper (FAO, 2011). National:The indicator is calculated as the number of stocks with sustainable status divided by the number of stocks with known status in the reference list. This proportion is calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance; that is, every fish stock is considered to have the same importance. Countries are requested to report the status of a reference list of fish stocks, which should be determined based on the significance of a specific stock in a society, either in landings, economic contribution to society, or cultural and traditional values, rather than based on whether stock assessment exists. The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources, and is an end-result measure of Target 14.4. Its derivation requires the data and technical expertise necessary to perform stock assessment. The indicator at global level is estimated by the FAO based on the methodology developed in the 1980s. Although regular updates were carried out to incorporate technical advances and changes in major fish species, some discrepancies between regions may occur in the representativeness of the reference list in practical fisheries. However, this will not pose a large impact on the reliability of the indicator’s temporal trends.For the national level, the composition of stocks within the reference list of stocks and the selection criteria used to develop the list will vary between countries, making the indicator suitable for checking countries’ own progress over time. However, this reduces the comparability of sustainability levels between countries. The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies. As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavour to provide the international community with the best information on the state of marine fishery resources.Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical models to data poor approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period 2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd IAEG-SDG in October 2015.The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed 'FAO Major Fishing Areas'.The Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries  are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, the FAO works to put in action 2030 Agenda’s emphasis on country ownership and higher the incentive to take actions at country, regional and global levels. FAO has developed, since 2018, a questionnaire approach  to allow individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at the global/regional levels, and 2) provides countries with simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional methods presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country’s EEZ, and therefore not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. The FAO has developed an online platform to facilitate the estimation and a country’s own report of the indicator. The platform provides an E-learning course that help countries to understand the indicator, estimation methodology and report process as well as some simple stock assessment methods that can be used to estimate stock status when only limited data are available to help address the capacity insufficiency faced by many developing countries.In 2019, the FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process. Data sources:The MSY-based reference point is often established through a formal stock assessment process. The data to inform stock assessments can come from many different sources, including fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources. Fishery-dependent data are collected from the fishery itself, using both commercial and recreational sources through reporting or sample-based surveys at sea, at landing sites, or within fishing communities. Data from these sources are generally compiled into fisheries statistics. They can include information on removals of fish from the sea, which can include landings and discards, and information on the fleet such as number of boats, number of tows, time spent on the sea.Fisheries-independent are obtained in ways not related to any fishing activity and are typically collected by scientists via surveys (often scientific cruises) designed to sample species abundance and biomass over long time series, and over consistent seasons and geographic areas. Typically, fisheries-independent data collect biological information on the species (age, length, weight, maturity, etc.), and habitat and environmental information (temperature, salinity, depth, etc.).Three primary categories of data inputs are required for stock assessment, including data on life history traits, and time series of catch and fishing effort. Stock abundance is often not known and relative abundance or indices are often used to reflect historical changes in population size. These data can be sourced from fishery-independent surveys, e.g. acoustic or trawl-based sampling, or from fishery-dependent estimates using catch and effort data. Life history parameters provides information on individual growth and stock productivity e.g. fish size, age, reproductive rates, and natural mortality. Catch is the amount of fish removed from a stock by all types of fishing.Global/Regional:Because of the high data demands of classical stock assessment methods, only a limited number of fish stocks have been assessed. These species account for 17–25 percent of the global catch (Branch et al., 2011), and most are caught by fisheries in developed countries. To balance the global representativeness of the assessment results and the goal of using the best available information, the FAO uses a wide spectrum of data and methods to extend its assessment to the fish stocks that account for the majority (70-80 percent) of the global catch (FAO, 2005).National: 	 	 	For country reporting, a questionnaire was sent out to all FAO member States with marine boundaries in 2019, and will be resent in 2020, 2021, and then on a two-year basis. For the complete list of questions used to inform this indicator, please refer to Appendix 2.Collection process:Global/regional: The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 represent a wide spectrum of data availability, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks to those that have very little information apart from catch statistics by FAO major fishing area and those with no stock assessment at all. For the purposes of using the best available data and information and maintaining consistency among stocks and assessors, a procedure has been defined to identify stock status information (FAO 2011). National: FAO collects national data through a questionnaire sent to the Principal Focal Point (PFP) of each country. The PFP organises an institutional set-up which identifies the competent authorities to develop a reference list of stocks and completes the questionnaire. The information or data collected through the questionnaire from a country will initially only inform individual country progress. Depending on the evolution and further standardization of country reporting over the next 3-5 years, national data may be used to inform global/regional estimates.

"SDG_ER_MTN_GRNCVI","Mountain Green Cover Index","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Mountain Green Cover Index The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is designed to measure the extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, crop land, etc. – in order to monitor progress towards the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. Mountain Green Cover The Mountain Green Cover index is based on two descriptor layers of information:1.	A mountain descriptor layer:  mountains can be defined with reference to a variety of parameters, such as climate, elevation, ecology (Körner, Paulsen, & Spehn, 2011) (Karagulle, et al., 2017). This methodology adheres to the UNEP- WCMC mountain definition, relying in turn on the mountain description proposed by (Kapos, Rhind, Edwards, Prince, & Ravillous, 2000).This description classifies mountains according altitude, slope and elevation range into 6 categories.Mountain Class / Description 1	Elevation > 4.500 meters2	Elevation 3.500–4.500 meters3	Elevation 2.500–3.500 meters4	Elevation 1.500–2.500 meters and slope > 25	Elevation 1.000–1.500 meters and slope > 5 or local elevation range (LER 7 kilometer radius) > 300 meters6 Elevation 300–1.000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometer radius) > 300 meters2.	A vegetation descriptor layer: The vegetation descriptor layer categorizes land cover into green and non-green areas. Green vegetation includes both natural vegetation and vegetation resulting from anthropic activity (e.g. crops, afforestation, etc.). Non-green areas include very sparsely vegetated areas, bare land, water, permanent ice/snow and urban areas. The vegetation description layer can be derived in different ways, but remote sensing based land cover maps are the most convenient data source for this purpose, as they provide the required information on green and non-green areas in a spatially explicit manner and allow for comparison over time through land cover change analysis. Currently, FAO uses land cover time series produced by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) as a general solution. The original CCI classes are re-classified into six IPCC classes and further into binary green/non-green cover classes as follows:ESA CCI class	/ IPCC class / Green/Non green50, 60, 61, 62, 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 82, 90, 100	/ Forest / Green110, 120, 121, 122, 130, 140 / Grassland / Green10,11, 12, 20, 30, 40 / Cropland / Green160, 170, 180 / Wetland / Green190 / Settlement / Non Green150, 151, 152, 153, 200, 201, 202, 210, 220 / Other land / Non GreenNANA The Mountain Green Cover Index is defined as:MGCI = (Mountain green cover area / Total mountain area) x 100where   - Mountain Green Cover area = Sum of areas covered by Cropland, Grassland, Forest and Wetland land cover classes.  - The vegetation descriptor is calculated from a land cover map using basic GIS functions.   - If the country/region has no mountain area, it will be assigned value N/A. The indicator can be calculated using freely available Earth Observation data and simple GIS operations that can be processed in free and open source software (FOSS) GIS. Potential limitations of the above describe methodology are related mainly to the quality of the land cover data. The ESA CCI land cover maps are currently available at 300 meter resolution which limits their applicability in the monitoring of small and highly heterogeneous landscapes. Therefore, if countries have national land cover maps of higher spatial resolution and comparable or better quality, FAO advises using them, following the same methodology presented here, for the generation of MGCI values. Regarding the interpretation of the indicator, although in the great majority of cases the desired direction is an increase in green mountain cover which reflects restriction of damage to natural ecosystems and possibly even the expansion of forest, shrubland and grasslands through conservation efforts, in more limited cases, an increase in the indicator value in high elevation classes may also signify the encroachment of vegetation on areas previously covered by glaciers or other permanent or semi-permanent ice or snow layers, as a result of global warming due to climate change. Such a change can be tracked with the current methodology and flagged accordingly at the level of disaggregated data by land cover type and elevation class, to distinguish this case from the general desired trend of increasing mountain green cover. Mountain ecosystems are important biodiversity centres that provide valuable ecosystem services to upstream and downstream areas. Yet, mountains are very fragile and impacted easily by both natural and anthropogenic factors. These can include climate change, natural hazards such as landslides and flooding, unplanned agricultural expansion, unplanned urbanization, timber extraction and recreational activities. The degradation of mountain ecosystems such as loss of the glacial cover, mountain biodiversity and green cover will affect the ability of the ecosystem to supply water downstream. The loss of forest and vegetative cover will reduce the ability of the ecosystem to retain soil and prevent landslides and flooding downstream. Therefore, monitoring mountain vegetation changes provides information on the status of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the MGCI over time can provide information on the extent of vegetational change and of the general health of the mountain ecosystem. Assessing the change of green cover differentiated by elevation is important in understanding the changes that are occurring in the mountain regions due to the influence of slope, aspect and altitude of the mountain terrain to the ecosystem. However, the MGCI values should be interpreted with care. It does not provide the details on species change, change in the tree line or rain shadow areas. Understanding the variation in the species composition and the tree line will be important in identifying the long-term impacts of climate change in mountain regions. Analysing the vegetative variations in each of the elevation zones over time will assist in determining the appropriate management and adaption measures. In some cases, an increase in the indicator value in high elevation classes may also signify the encroachment of vegetation on areas previously covered by glaciers or other permanent or semi-permanent ice or snow layers, as a result of global warming due to climate change. Such a change can be tracked with the current methodology and flagged accordingly at the level of disaggregated data by land cover type and elevation class, to distinguish this case from the general desired trend of increasing mountain green cover. Data sources:1)	ESA CCI Land Cover data The European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) is a programme aiming at exploiting the full potential of the earth observation data collected by ESA to contribute to the Essential Climate Variables databases required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The CCI Land Cover products have been produced using a combination of remote sensing data such as the 300 m MERIS, 1km SPOT –VEGETATION, 1km PROBA –V and 1km AVHRR. The CCI product consists of a series of annual Land Cover maps at 300 m resolution spanning the period 1992 to 2018. The period from 1992-2015 is available in raster format, whereas the 2016-2018 is available in netCDF format and a transformation to GTIFF is required to make these datasets available for processing in a GIS environment. The land cover data is updated every year by the European Space Agency.  The ESA CCI adheres to the Cover Classification System of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) (Santoro, et al., 2015). 2)	Kapos mountain class layer:The Kapos dataset is a global mountain descriptor raster file. The file provides a classification of mountain ranges in accordance with the definitions proposed by Kapos et al 2000 :- Class 1:  elevation > 4500 meters - Class 2:  elevation 3500 - 4500 meters- Class 3:  elevation 2500 – 3500 meters - Class 4: elevation 1500 – 2500 meters and slope = 2- Class 5: elevation 1,000–1,500 meters and slope = 5 or local elevation range (7 kilometers radius) = 300 meters- Class 6: elevation 300–1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometres radius) = 300 meters outside 23°N—19°S - Class 0: Defined to represent the non-mountainous areas. Collection process:The indicator is generated for all countries and regions having mountain areas by FAO using the geospatial data layers described in this document. FAO shares country figures with NSO SDG focal points for their validation before publication, in accordance to the IAEG-SDG guidelines of Global Data Flows and Reporting. On the same occasion, FAO requests countries to provide their own estimates for the indicator in case these are available.

National Human Rights Institution A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the 'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centers and multiple institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with ‘A level’ accreditation status as benchmarked against the Paris Principles. The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the GAHNRI. There are three possible types of accreditation: A: Compliance with Paris Principles B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles Accreditation by the GANHRI entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems.The Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles) adopted by General Assembly, Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993 provide the international benchmarks against which NHRIs can be accredited by the GANHRI.NANA In terms of method of computation, the indicator is computed as the accreditation classification, namely A, B or C of the NHRI. The important and constructive role of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights has been acknowledged in different United Nations instruments and resolutions, including the Final Document and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, GA resolutions A/RES/63/172 (2008) and A/RES/64/161 (2009) on National institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been encouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 ‘affirms the priority that should be accorded to the development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective implementation of international human rights standards’ while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 encouraged states ‘to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions’. The Human Rights Council (HRC resolution 5/1, 2007) also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its institution building package, which provides elements to guide its future work. UN treaty bodies have also recognized the crucial role that NHRIs represent in the effective implementation of treaty obligations and encouraged their creation (e.g. CERD General Comment 17, A/48/18 (1993); CESCR General Comment 10, E/C.12/1998/25; and CRC General Comment 2, CRC/GC/2002/2). A compilation of various recommendations and concluding observations relevant to NHRIs emanating from the international human rights mechanisms in the United Nations is available at: http://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/. The GANHRI is an international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are based on their submitted documents such as: 1) copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered in its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential decree, 2) outline of organizational structure including details of staff and annual budget, 3) copy of recent published annual report; 4) detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. NHRIs that hold ‘A’ and ‘B’ status are reviewed every five years. Civil society organizations may also provide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter. Accreditation of NHRIs shows that the government supports human rights work in the country. However their effectiveness should also be measured based on their ability to gain public trust and the quality of their human rights work. In this context, it would also be worthwhile to look into the responses of the NHRI to the recommendations of the GANHRI. Likewise, the inputs from the NHRI while engaging with the international human rights mechanisms (i.e. submissions to the Human Rights Council, including UPR, and to the treaty bodies) represent a valuable source of information on how NHRIs carry out their mandate in reference to international human rights instruments. This indicator measures the global continual efforts of countries in setting up independent national institutions, through international cooperation, to promote inclusive, peaceful and accountable societies. The creation and fosterage of a NHRI indicates a State’s commitment to promote and protect the human rights provided in international human rights instruments. Compliance with the Paris Principles vest NHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights situation, and publicize human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially state funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. When vested with a quasi-judicial competence, NHRIs handle complaints and assist victims in taking their cases to courts making them an essential component in the national human rights protection system. These fundamental functions that NHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important actors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws and the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws. At the national level reporting, the better the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and effective in promoting human rights at the national level.

National Human Rights Institution A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the 'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centers and multiple institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with ‘A level’ accreditation status as benchmarked against the Paris Principles. The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the GAHNRI. There are three possible types of accreditation: A: Compliance with Paris Principles B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles Accreditation by the GANHRI entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems.The Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles) adopted by General Assembly, Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993 provide the international benchmarks against which NHRIs can be accredited by the GANHRI.NANA In terms of method of computation, the indicator is computed as the accreditation classification, namely A, B or C of the NHRI. The important and constructive role of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights has been acknowledged in different United Nations instruments and resolutions, including the Final Document and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, GA resolutions A/RES/63/172 (2008) and A/RES/64/161 (2009) on National institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been encouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 ‘affirms the priority that should be accorded to the development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective implementation of international human rights standards’ while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 encouraged states ‘to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions’. The Human Rights Council (HRC resolution 5/1, 2007) also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its institution building package, which provides elements to guide its future work. UN treaty bodies have also recognized the crucial role that NHRIs represent in the effective implementation of treaty obligations and encouraged their creation (e.g. CERD General Comment 17, A/48/18 (1993); CESCR General Comment 10, E/C.12/1998/25; and CRC General Comment 2, CRC/GC/2002/2). A compilation of various recommendations and concluding observations relevant to NHRIs emanating from the international human rights mechanisms in the United Nations is available at: http://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/. The GANHRI is an international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are based on their submitted documents such as: 1) copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered in its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential decree, 2) outline of organizational structure including details of staff and annual budget, 3) copy of recent published annual report; 4) detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. NHRIs that hold ‘A’ and ‘B’ status are reviewed every five years. Civil society organizations may also provide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter. Accreditation of NHRIs shows that the government supports human rights work in the country. However their effectiveness should also be measured based on their ability to gain public trust and the quality of their human rights work. In this context, it would also be worthwhile to look into the responses of the NHRI to the recommendations of the GANHRI. Likewise, the inputs from the NHRI while engaging with the international human rights mechanisms (i.e. submissions to the Human Rights Council, including UPR, and to the treaty bodies) represent a valuable source of information on how NHRIs carry out their mandate in reference to international human rights instruments. This indicator measures the global continual efforts of countries in setting up independent national institutions, through international cooperation, to promote inclusive, peaceful and accountable societies. The creation and fosterage of a NHRI indicates a State’s commitment to promote and protect the human rights provided in international human rights instruments. Compliance with the Paris Principles vest NHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights situation, and publicize human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially state funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. When vested with a quasi-judicial competence, NHRIs handle complaints and assist victims in taking their cases to courts making them an essential component in the national human rights protection system. These fundamental functions that NHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important actors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws and the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws. At the national level reporting, the better the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and effective in promoting human rights at the national level.

The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-led results frameworks reflecting the country’s development priorities and goals. Country results frameworks (CRFs Country results frameworks (CRFs) define a country’s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government’s planning documents. The definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.In practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs.NANA To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from government sources –including national, sector and subnational planning tools.For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are assessed:- Q1.

Formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfWhen aggregating, the size of the project/ intervention is not considered as weight in order to give the same level of importance to the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools in medium-sized vs. larger projects, as the indicator tries to capture the overall behaviour of development partners in designing new interventions in a given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise over represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. Data collection covered about 80 low and middle-income countries for the 2015-2016 period. The number of countries covered is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond. The estimates for high-income countries are generated taking as a reference their role as development cooperation providers.The monitoring exercise collects data beyond the scope of the proposed indicator, including additional aspects such as government of development partners’ engagement in planning project/programme evaluations. Measuring the alignment of development partners’ support to country priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of 'respect for each country’s policy space and leadership to establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development'.  In particular, for interventions approved in the year of reference (i.e. most recent behaviour), the assessment measures the extent to which support from other countries and international organizations set exogenous priorities and conditions to partner countries receiving development co-operation that are not reflected in existing country-led priority-setting mechanisms or planning tools.The information collected throughout the indicator provides a 'two-way mirror', providing both a country-level estimate on a country’s existing policy space, and a development partner-level estimate on its degree of alignment with existing results frameworks and priority- setting mechanisms in partner countries where it operates. Data sources:The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting countries in collecting relevant data on a biennial basis through the Global Partnership monitoring framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level.Collection process:(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership's monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country government.

This also includes countries which compile their detailed population and housing statistics from population registers, administrative records, sample surveys or other sources or a combination of those sources.17.19.2 (b) - Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration:This information only refers to 17.19.2 (b): Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registrationAccording to the Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3 (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/principles/M19Rev3en.pdf), a complete civil registration is defined as:  'The registration in the civil registration system of every vital event that has occurred to the members of the population of a particular country (or area), within a specified period as a result of which every such event has a vital registration record and the system has attained 100 per cent coverage.'In a given country or area, the level of completeness of birth registration can be different from the level of completeness of death registration. There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or death registration systems. An elaboration of these methods is available at Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3.  The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness  of birth and death registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment,  and F. Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).Indicator 17.19.2(b) has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area.     17.19.2 (b) - Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration:                The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) are expressed as proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration to the total number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both birth and death registration sub-indicators. The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical Annex to the 2017 SG’s progress report, available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf (please refer to the last two pages). These data are compiled using the country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, via the Demographic Yearbook Vital Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations Demographic Yearbook collection and associated online compilations are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Please refer to: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm At the present time, the thresholds used for compiling the data for the indicator 17.19.2(b) are 90 per cent for birth registration and 75 per cent for death registration, due to the classification that has been used in the Demographic Yearbook metadata questionnaire on vital statistics. This classification has currently been modified to enable reporting according to the exact formulation of the indicator 17.19.2(b).  17.19.2 (a) - Proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years:                Population and housing censuses are one of the primary sources of data needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring policies and programmes aimed at inclusive socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability. Population and housing censuses are an important source for supplying disaggregated data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially in the context of assessing the situation of people by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other characteristics.In recognition of the above, the ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme urges Member States to conduct at least one population and housing census during the period from 2015 to 2024, taking into account international and regional recommendations relating to population and housing censuses and giving particular attention to advance planning, cost efficiency, coverage and the timely dissemination of, and easy access to, census results for national stakeholders, the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations in order to inform decisions and facilitate the effective implementation of development plans and programmes.The indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years and hence provides information on the availability of disaggregated population and housing data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.17.19.2 (b) - Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration:The introduction of indicator 17.19.2 (b) as part of the SDG global framework reflects the recognition of the fundamental role of the civil registration system to the functioning of societies, and the legal and protective advantages that it offers to individuals. The essential purpose of civil registration system is to furnish legal documents of direct interest to individuals. Aside from the direct and overarching importance of civil registration to the public authorities, in that the information compiled using the registration method provides essential data for national and regional preparation and planning for medical and health-care programmes,  the role played by civil registration in proving, establishing, implementing and realizing many of the human rights embodied in international declarations and conventions reflects one of its most important contributions to the normal functioning of societies. 17.19.2 (a) - Proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years:        ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme requests the Secretary-General to 'monitor and regularly report to the Statistical Commission on the implementation of the Programme'.

There exist several methods for the evaluation of completeness of birth or death registration systems. An elaboration of these methods is available at Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System, Revision 3.  The evaluation and monitoring of quality and completeness  of birth and death registration systems are addressed in Part three, sub-Chapters: D. Quality assessment methods; E. Direct versus indirect assessment,  and F. Choosing appropriate methods for assessing completeness and qualitative accuracy of registration and register-based vital statistics (para 579 to 622).Indicator 17.19.2(b) has two parts; the first concerning the birth registration and the second concerning the death registration of each individual country or area.     17.19.2 (b) - Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration:                The two sub-indicators of the indicator 17.19.2(b) are expressed as proportions: at the global level, the proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration is measured as the number of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration to the total number of countries. The computation is done in an analogous manner for the death registration part as well as for the regional measurements of both birth and death registration sub-indicators. The latest compiled data for this indicator are part of the Statistical Annex to the 2017 SG’s progress report, available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/report/2017/secretary-general-sdg-report-2017--Statistical-Annex.pdf (please refer to the last two pages). These data are compiled using the country-reported information on availability and completeness of birth and death registration data at the country level, to the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, via the Demographic Yearbook Vital Statistics questionnaire and accompanying metadata. United Nations Demographic Yearbook collection and associated online compilations are published by the United Nations Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Please refer to: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/default.htm At the present time, the thresholds used for compiling the data for the indicator 17.19.2(b) are 90 per cent for birth registration and 75 per cent for death registration, due to the classification that has been used in the Demographic Yearbook metadata questionnaire on vital statistics. This classification has currently been modified to enable reporting according to the exact formulation of the indicator 17.19.2(b).  17.19.2 (a) - Proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years:                Population and housing censuses are one of the primary sources of data needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring policies and programmes aimed at inclusive socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability. Population and housing censuses are an important source for supplying disaggregated data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially in the context of assessing the situation of people by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other characteristics.In recognition of the above, the ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme urges Member States to conduct at least one population and housing census during the period from 2015 to 2024, taking into account international and regional recommendations relating to population and housing censuses and giving particular attention to advance planning, cost efficiency, coverage and the timely dissemination of, and easy access to, census results for national stakeholders, the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations in order to inform decisions and facilitate the effective implementation of development plans and programmes.The indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years and hence provides information on the availability of disaggregated population and housing data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.17.19.2 (b) - Proportion of countries that have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration:The introduction of indicator 17.19.2 (b) as part of the SDG global framework reflects the recognition of the fundamental role of the civil registration system to the functioning of societies, and the legal and protective advantages that it offers to individuals. The essential purpose of civil registration system is to furnish legal documents of direct interest to individuals. Aside from the direct and overarching importance of civil registration to the public authorities, in that the information compiled using the registration method provides essential data for national and regional preparation and planning for medical and health-care programmes,  the role played by civil registration in proving, establishing, implementing and realizing many of the human rights embodied in international declarations and conventions reflects one of its most important contributions to the normal functioning of societies. 17.19.2 (a) - Proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years:        ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme requests the Secretary-General to 'monitor and regularly report to the Statistical Commission on the implementation of the Programme'.

Before 2005 data are reported according the 5th Balance of Payments Manual. After 2005, data have been converted according to the categories and principles established by the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Export shares need to be analysed from different angles in order to infer whether a particular country or region made improvements in its trade performance. First of all, exports value should be always kept into account in order to observe whether changes in export shares are originating from increasing developing and LDCs exports or from a decrease of other countries exported values. Secondly, and in order to foster trade that is beneficial for the other SDGs, it would be useful to analyze the composition of the export basket by the level of processing of the goods that are traded. This will allow understanding whether progress are made in terms of the quality and value added of the products exported. In addition to that, while some exports like arms, oil and other natural resources would require a separate analysis, the calculation of export diversification indicators would be recommended to assess the progress made by developing and LDCs in terms of productivity and improvement of their export portfolio.For what concerns trade in services, it could be necessary to draw on supplementary data from migration, tourism, multinational companies (MNC) and labour market statistics, in order to provide detailed figures for Travel and Government services n.i.e. A typical area of interest for international trade in services relates to the data that may be maintained by governments on education and health services provided to or by non-residents (travel; personal, cultural and recreational services).

Using shares of global exports provide information on the relative size of Developing and LDCs export in comparison to global exports. Data sources:Trade in goods data included in the ITC (Trade Map) database are collected by contacting directly focal points in national agencies or regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic communities). Trade in goods data included in the WTO (IDB) database are sourced from official notifications of WTO members. Trade in goods data are complemented, when needed using the UN COMTRADE database.Trade in services data are sourced from a joint ITC/UNCTAD/WTO database, prevalently based on balance of payments accounts data maintained by the IMF, OECD and EUROSTAT.

Sentenced 'Sentenced' refers to persons subject to criminal proceedings who have received a decision from a competent authority regarding their conviction or acquittal. For the purposes of the indicator, persons who have received a ‘non-final’ decision (such as where a conviction is subject to appeal) are considered to be 'sentenced'.NANA The total number of unsentenced persons held in detention divided by the total number of persons held in detention, on a specified date. The target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two indicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice system. The proposed indicator 16.3.2 covers the efficiency of the justice system. The indicator signifies overall respect for the principle that persons awaiting trial shall not be detained in custody unnecessarily. This, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its proportionate use. Data sources:UNODC collects data on prisons through its annual data collection (UN-CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities. Data on unsentenced and total detainees from the UN-CTS are available for 114 countries. The country coverage can improve if other sources (research institutions and NGOs) are included (data for additional 60 countries are available, bringing the total for the period 2012-2014 to 174 countries). Data for two points in time (2003-2005 and 2012-2014 three year averages) are available for 144 countries.Collection process:There is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS) which represents the basis of data on unsentenced detainees. The UN-CTS data collection is largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are institutions/officials appointed by countries and having the technical capacity and role to produce data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 appointed Focal Points as of 2016). In addition, these data are supplemented for countries with missing values with official data collected by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research (World Prison Brief), which collects data directly from national prison administrations or from the websites of Ministries of Justice or other official agencies.

"SDG_VC_VAW_MTUHRA","Number of cases of killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Number of cases of killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists This indicator is defined as the number of verified cases of killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful acts committed against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders on an annual basis.‘Journalists’ refers to everyone who observes, describes, documents and analyses events, statements, policies, and any propositionsthat can affect society, with the purpose of systematizing such information and gathering of facts and analyses to inform sectors of society or society as a whole, and others who share these journalistic functions, including all media workers and support staff, as well as community media workers and so-called 'citizen journalists' when they momentarily play that role,2 professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as bloggers and others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the internet or elsewhere.3‘Trade unionists’ refers to everyone exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.4 A trade union is an association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.5‘Human rights defenders’ refers to everyone exercising their right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at national and international levels,6 including some journalists and trade unionists. While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human rights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.The different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance with international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the OHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). As such:- ‘Killing’ is defined as any extrajudicial execution or other unlawful killing by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence that were motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; or while the victim was engaged in such activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; and other unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law leading to or intending to cause the victim’s death., corresponding to ICCS codes 0101, 0102 and 110139 and coded herein as A [0101, 0102 and 110139].- `Enforced disappearance’ refers to the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a victim by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the victim, which places the victim outside the protection of the law, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (forced disappearance) and coded herein as B [02022ED]- ‘Torture’ refers to any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, for such purposes as obtaining from them or a third person information or a confession, punishing them, intimidating them or coercing them, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other persons acting in an official capacity, corresponding to ICCS code 11011 and coded herein as C [11011].- ‘Arbitrary detention’ refers to any arrest or detention not in accordance with national laws, because it is not properly based on grounds established by law, or does not conform to the procedures established by law, or is otherwise deemed arbitrary in the sense of being inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable or unnecessary in the circumstances, and motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (unlawful deprivation of liberty) and coded herein as D [020222AD]- ‘Kidnapping’ refers to unlawfully detaining, taking away and/or confining a victim without their consent by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State, and the unlawful detention and/or confinement was met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to the unlawful detention, such a failure motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 020221 and coded herein as E [020221]- ‘Other harmful acts’ refers to other acts by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence causing harm or intending to cause harm and motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 0211, and coded herein as F [0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 0211].‘Verified cases’ refer to reported cases that contain a minimum set of relevant information on particular persons and circumstances, which have been reviewed by mandated bodies, mechanisms, and institutions, and provided them with reasonable grounds to believe those persons were victims of the above-mentioned human rights violations or abuses. Intentional homicide The operational definitions of the cases, victims and other elements of the indicator have been patterned as far as practicable after corresponding categories in ICCS. The task of classifying cases entails observing events from both statistical standards and international law perspectives. For example, intentional homicide (ICCS code 0101) is included as a component of the violation type ‘killing’ and is in turn supplemented by applicable human rights standards:- 0101 Intentional homicide. Inclusions: murder; serious assault leading to death; femicide ; honour killing; voluntary manslaughter; killings caused by excessive use of force by law enforcement officials; extrajudicial and extra-legal, summary or arbitrary executions. [human rights standards added in italics]This conceptual approach is necessitated by the confluence of three factors. First is the principle that all the violent acts tracked by the indicator are motivated by the exercise of fundamental freedoms that are guaranteed by human rights law to all persons. Second, while human rights abuses are not always explicitly criminalized in domestic jurisdictions, ICCS has achieved a certain level of success in terms of integrating human rights elements in the classification of crimes.Third, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislation or practices, all events – whether ordinary crimes or human rights violations – that meet the elements provided in the definitional framework will be counted for statistical purposes.NANA The indicator is calculated as the total count of victims of reported incidents occurring within the preceding 12 months.Drawing on the ICCS, which is an incidents-based international classification system, the indicator counts victims on the basis of cases of violations or abuses using a classification framework developed for the purposes of the indicator.For reporting purposes, the recorded offences will be ordered taking into account a hierarchy of violations or abuses drawing on the 'most serious offence' rule commonly applied in crime statistics:1.	Killing2.	Torture3.	Enforced disappearance4.	Arbitrary detention5.	Kidnapping6.	Other harmful actsIf an incident incorporates elements of more than one category, it is coded to the higher category. Thus for an incident in which the victim was subjected to prolonged incommunicado detention without medical access in the course of an unlawful detainment, the violation would be counted under torture. As for other crime statistics and other statistics based on administrative sources, this indicator is sensitive to the completeness of reporting of individual events. There is a real but manageable risk of underreporting. Moreover, reporting rates and statistical accuracy are influenced by various factors, including changes and biases in victim reporting behaviour, changes in police and recording practices or rules, new laws, processing errors and non-responsive institutions.Regional and global aggregates may underestimate the true incidence and vol ume of victimization, overcompensate for robust and inclusive national data collection systems . In most instances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to information, motivation and perseverance of national stakeholders, of human rights defenders themselves, and the corresponding support of the international community. This indicator seeks to measure enjoyment of fundamental freedoms (e.g. freedom of opinion, freedom of expression and access to information, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association) on the premise that killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful act against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders have a chilling effect on the exercise of these fundamental freedoms. What distinguishes this indicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population by sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal factor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of others, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such activities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator provides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental freedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet human rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms. Data sources:Data will be collected from global, regional and national mandated bodies, mechanisms and institutions that generate and maintain administrative data whether in aggregated form or at micro-level:- Global mechanisms  -	OHCHR     * Data from OHCHR monitoring work     * Data from the work of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council     * Data from the Treaty Bodies reporting system     * Press Releases and Statements of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights     * Other reports and publications, such as the UN Secretary General’s Report on Reprisals     * Other mandated reports and publications  - UNESCO     * Journalists Killings Condemned by the UNESCO Director General     * Other mandated reports and publications  - ILO     * Cases reviewed by the Committee on Freedom of Association     * Other mandated reports and publications   - Other UN agencies or entities producing relevant reports- Regional mechanisms- National mechanisms  - National Human Rights Institutions  - National monitoring and protection mechanisms for journalists, trade unionists and/or human rights defenders  - Justice sector institutions such as Ministries of Justice, Interior etc  - National Statistical Offices in their general role to coordinate national statistical systemsIntegration of data from all possible sources for this indicator will be made possible through the use of standard definitions, data collection methods, reference period, counting units and counting rules.Collection process:Data will be compiled from administrative data produced by OHCHR, ILO, UNESCO and other UN agencies or entities in accordance with their respective mandates and procedures.For example, with the support of OHCHR, the various Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council undertake country visits and act on individual cases by sending communications to States and occasionally, to non-State actors, in which they bring alleged violations or abuses to their attention for action, among other functions. Special Procedures report annually to the Human Rights Council and the majority of the mandate-holders also report to the General Assembly.According to Section 40 of the Manual of Operations of Special Procedures, a decision to take action on a case or situation rests on the discretion of the mandate-holder. That discretion should be exercised in light of the mandate entrusted to him or her as well as criteria generally relating to the reliability of the source; the credibility of information received; the details provided; and the scope of the mandate. Every effort is made to determine the probable validity of alleged incidents and the reliability of the source before the special rapporteur makes contact with the Government of the State where the alleged abuse is thought to have occurred. Contact is usually conducted through an 'urgent appeal' or 'allegation' letter addressed to the State’s diplomatic mission with the United Nations in Geneva for transmission to capitals. These communications are used to ask the Government to take all appropriate action to investigate and address the alleged events and to communicate the results of its investigation and actions to the Special Rapporteur. Communications as well as State replies are kept confidential until the end of the reporting period. The mandate-holder then reports these cases to the Human Rights Council or the General Assembly.Regarding UNESCO’s statistics on the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data on the killings of journalists corresponds to all of the cases of journalists’ killings that have been condemned by the UNESCO Director-General. These cases are identified based on reports from multiple sources, including from international, regional and local monitoring groups; UNESCO field offices; UNESCO Permanent Delegations; and other UN bodies. This follows the methodology requested by the IPDC Council through the 2012 IPDC Decision on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue ofImpunity, which states that the report should be the result of 'analysis and comparison of information from a broad and diverse range of sources for the sake of ensuring objectivity, including updated information provided by the relevant Member States on a voluntary basis on the killing of journalists, and non-responses, and be made widely available'.As concerns the status of judicial enquiries into the killings of journalists, UNESCO’s data is based solely on information provided by the Member States in which ki llings of journalists condemned by UNESCO’s Director-General have occurred. Each year, UNESCO sends out a letter to the Permanent Delegations of these Member States requesting them for an official update on the judicial follow-up to the cases of killed journalists. It is the Permanent Delegation’s responsibility to transfer the letter to the competent authorities at national level. On the basis of the information provided, UNESCO prepares the Director-General’s Report on the Safety of Journalists or the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Report, depending on the year.To a large extent, these procedures are typical of monitoring mechanisms under international law. OHCHR, UNESCO, ILO and other agencies that are responsible for these mechanisms take particular care to integrate in these standard operating procedures the requirement of consultation with the Member States concerned.Similarly, ILO is able to verify reported violations and abuses committed against trade unionists using data from its stakeholders.As a result of these processes, administrative data on violence against journalists, trade unionists and other human rights defenders are generated by international organizations. OHCHR will compile and integrate the data using a common data management tool.In the future, National Human Rights Institutions, National Statistical Offices, other government agencies as well as civil society organizations and networks will play an important role in the collection of data. NHRIs, on the basis of their own mandate, are able to investigate cases of violations and abuses brought to their attention. Several NHRIs have also institutionalized theprovision of legal advice and other forms of support to victims of abuses who wish to access international mechanisms. NSOs, on the other hand, can complement this work by ensuring the implementation of internationally-accepted statistical standards, including on data exchange and dissemination for this indicator.OHCHR, UNESCO and ILO will work jointly with national stakeholders to build capacity, harmonize data collection procedures and produce globally comparable results.

"SDG_AG_LND_FRSTBIOPHA","Above-ground biomass stock in forest (tonnes per hectare)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Above-ground biomass stock in forest (tonnes per hectare) 'Sustainable forest management' (SFM) is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations' (Resolution A/RES/62/98) The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. The sub-indicators are: 1.	Forest area annual net change rate 2.	Above-ground biomass stock in forest 3.	Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas 4.	Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan 5.	Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme     National data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under management plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on the country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate using the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under management plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference year 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme are reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly adjusting the figures to remove any double accounting. No dashboard traffic lights are made at country level. The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, as the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. While the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. The definition of SFM by the UN General Assembly contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances – ecological, social and economic – vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. Clearly a simple measure of forest area is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The significance of the five sub-indicators can be briefly explained as follows: 1.	Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-indicator focuses on both the direction of change (whether there is a loss or gain in forest area) and how the change rate is changing over time; the latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are losing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest area loss. 2.	Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the balance between gains in biomass stock due to forest growth and losses due to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and diseases. At country level and over a longer period, sustainable forest management would imply a stable or increasing biomass stock per hectare, while a long-term reduction of biomass stock per hectare would imply either unsustainable management of the forests and degradation or unexpected major losses due to fire, wind, pests or diseases. 3.	The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy for trends in conservation of forest biodiversity as well as cultural and spiritual values of forests and thus a clear indication of the political will to protect and conserve forests. This indicator is related to the CBD Aichi Target 11 which calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas. 4.	The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest area that is under a long term forest management plan. The existence of a documented forest management plan is the basis for long term and sustainable management of the forest resources for a variety of management objectives such as for wood and non-wood forest products, protection of soil and water, biodiversity conservation, social and cultural use, and a combination of two or several of these. An increasing area under forest management plan is therefore an indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management. 5.	The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an independently verified forest management certification scheme. Such certification schemes apply standards that generally are higher than those established by the countries’ own normative frameworks, and compliance is verified by an independent and accredited certifier. An increase in certified forest area therefore provides an additional indication of progress towards sustainable forest management. It should however be noted that there are significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible or affordable certification scheme is in place for that area. Data sources:        Sub-indicators 1 to 4FAO has been monitoring the world's forests at 5 to 10 year intervals since 1946. The Global Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) are now produced every five year. The latest of these assessments, FRA 2020, contains information for 236 countries and territories on about 60 variables related to the extent of forests, their conditions, uses and values for several points in time. Collection process: Data on the sub-indicators are collected periodically (until now every 5 years) by FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) programme. Officially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the country reports for the assessment. Some prepare more than one report as they also report on dependent territories. For the remaining countries and territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO using existing information and a literature search. All data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report through an on-line platform following a standard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time. The on-line platform was used for all data entry, review and quality control.In order to obtain internationally comparable data, countries are requested to provide national categories and definitions, and in case these are different than the FAO categories and definitions, countries are requested to perform a reclassification of national data to correspond to the FAO categories and definitions and to document this step in the country report. Countries are also requested to use interpolation or extrapolation of national data in order to provide estimates for the specific reporting years. Sub-indicator 5Data on forest certification is submitted annually to FAO by the head offices of the respective forest certification scheme. Data include the area certified by each scheme, as well as areas that are double-certified by the two main schemes. That allows for estimating the total certified forest area, adjusted for double certified area. Collection process: Currently, forest certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are included in the data submissions. The latter includes several national/regional certification schemes that have been endorsed according to the PEFC standards. Data reported by the certification bodies and consolidated into estimates of total certified forest area are made available to the countries through an online platform where country officials can view the data that are being submitted.

It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use'. More specifically:- Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.- It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.- It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.- It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.- It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.- It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.- It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.- It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.- It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the 'Taungya' system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest. Total land area Total land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.NA Forest area (reference year) / Land area (2015) * 100This indicator can be aggregated to global or regional level by adding all country values globally or in a specific region. Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries. Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation of forest area using remote sensing techniques for has certain challenges. In particular they relate to the assessment of land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land cover), and gradual changes, such as forest regrowth, that can require several years to become detectable. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are still difficult to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing techniques. Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including the provision of goods (wood and non-wood forest products) and services such as habitats for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal protection and soil and water conservation. The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a country. The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development.Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural sector.Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are sustainably managed.The indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator7.1 'Proportion of land covered by forest').

It refers to the efforts by countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance.  The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.   The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.     Summation of information made available by each Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity and to the International Treaty related to:ABS legislative, administrative or policy measures made available to the ABS Clearing-House and to the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (y/n) This indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks over time.This indicator does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks. The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules established on access and benefit-sharing. However, it is difficult to have a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative, administrative and policy framework, and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Nagoya Protocol, to be operational, requires that certain enabling conditions are met at the national level for its effective implementation.  In particular, countries will need, depending on their specific circumstances, to revise legislative, administrative or policy measures already in place or develop new measures in order to meet the obligations set out under the Protocol.  In particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by indigenous communities, and benefits arising from the utilization of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same manner. The goal is to allow users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge to easily find information on the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources and knowledge in an organized manner, and all in one convenient location.The International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and procedures with their obligations under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other facilitated access to their plant genetic resources, while users of plant genetic material from the Multilateral System are encouraged to share their benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow to farmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. Pursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and operational mechanism to promote compliance and address issues of non-compliance.  Under the monitoring and reporting in the Procedures, each Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty, including the access and benefit-sharing measures. Contracting Parties report using an agreed standard format and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance. Additionally, information on the number of Standard Material Transfer Agreements is gathered from the Data Store of the International Treaty through Easy-SMTA. SMTA is a mandatory contract that Contracting Parties of the International Treaty have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources falling under the Multilateral System are made available.  Indicator 15.6.1 directly measures progress made by countries in establishing legislative, administrative or policy frameworks on access and benefit-sharing (ABS). By developing their ABS frameworks, countries are contributing to the achievement of SDG Target 15.6 and to the conservation and sustainable use of biological and genetic diversity. Progress in this indicator is assessed through measuring the increase in the number of countries that have adopted ABS legislative, administrative and policy measures and that have made available this information in the ABS Clearing-House and through the Online Reporting System on Compliance of the International Treaty in relation to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.

"SDG_ER_MRN_MARINT","Protected marine area (Exclusive Economic Zones) (square kilometres)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Protected marine area (Exclusive Economic Zones) (square kilometres) The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas. Protected areas Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve- Category Ib: Wilderness area- Category II: National park- Category III: Natural monument or feature- Category IV: Habitat/species management area- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources Designated area The status 'designated' is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). Site contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally criteria  set out in A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Key Biodiversity Areas encompass (a) Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >13,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world’s countries (BirdLife International 2014, Donald et al. 2018); (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, of which 853 sites have been identified for 1,483 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, freshwater crustaceans, reef-building corals, conifers, cycads and other taxa; (c) Key Biodiversity Areas identified under an earlier version of the Key Biodiversity Area criteria (Langhammer et al. 2007), including those identified in Ecosystem Hotspot Profiles developed with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. These three subsets are being reassessed using the Global Standard, which unifies these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems (IUCN 2016). This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC & IUCN 2020) and digital polygons for marine Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified as marine Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and an ocean raster layer (produced from the ‘adm0’ layer from the database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM 2019)), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a marine Key Biodiversity Area where it had =5% overlap with the ocean layer (hence some sites were classified as both marine and terrestrial). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered. Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (BirdLife International 2019).The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to 'green listing' have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, 'other effective area-based conservation measures', as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, the formally agreed definition of an OECM ('A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values') were only agreed in November 2018 and measures are only recently in place for countries to submit OECM data to UNEP-WCMC. OECMs are now collated by UNEP-WCMC in a separate database, the WD-OECM.Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise <50% of the species for which Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified, and as Key Biodiversity Area identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or 'irreplaceability') using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of marine Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of marine vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates). The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of marine natural resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.The indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010). Data sources:Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through Protected Planet, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016).Key Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds. Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas, managed by BirdLife International. Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at  http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at https://zeroextinction.org. Both datasets, along with Key Biodiversity Areas identified through other processes, are available through the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas, and along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning.Collection process:See information under other sections.

"SDG_IC_FRM_BRIB","Bribery incidence (% of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Bribery incidence (% of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request) Proportion of firms asked for a gift or informal payment when meeting with tax officials. In every Enterprise Survey (www.enterprisesurveys.org), there is a standard question which asks the survey respondent if they were inspected by or required to meet with tax officials. If the respondent indicates ‘yes’, then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during these inspections/meetings. The response options include 'yes', 'no', 'don’t know', and 'refuse'.Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm’s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years. Bribe The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodologyA gift or an informal payment is considered a ‘bribe’.NANA The indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion of firms which answered ‘yes’ to the survey question. For all Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality.The limitations include that some countries’ data is almost 10 years old (e.g. South Africa and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn’t been able to update some of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence most high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, Western European countries, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).Another limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on corruption. Although the data is collected under the context of confidentiality, firms may refuse to answer the question if they have been subject to bribery solicitations. Hence, in some countries, the actual incidence of this particular type of corruption may be higher than the calculated indicator value. The rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when meeting with tax officials. Paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of corruption during this routine interaction. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s reality.

The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-led results frameworks reflecting the country’s development priorities and goals. Country results frameworks (CRFs Country results frameworks (CRFs) define a country’s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government’s planning documents. The definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.In practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs.NANA To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from government sources –including national, sector and subnational planning tools.For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are assessed:- Q1. Whether objectives are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies 0/1- Q2. Share of results (outcome) indicators that are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies %- Q3. Share of results (outcome) indicators that will rely on sources of data provided by existing country-led monitoring systems or national statistical services to track project progress %Aggregated averages per partner country will provide an assessment of the country’s available policy space and leadership. All formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfAggregated averages per development partner will indicate the percentage of alignment with country-led priority setting mechanisms. Formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfNote that data to weight the results by development partner’s actual contributions in terms of development finance is available, if requested by the IAEG SDG / UN Statistical Commission. A global aggregate for the indicator is obtained by averaging the three dimensions of alignment with country’s priorities and goals across all new interventions for the reporting year. Formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfWhen aggregating, the size of the project/ intervention is not considered as weight in order to give the same level of importance to the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools in medium-sized vs. larger projects, as the indicator tries to capture the overall behaviour of development partners in designing new interventions in a given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise over represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. Data collection covered about 80 low and middle-income countries for the 2015-2016 period. The number of countries covered is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond. The estimates for high-income countries are generated taking as a reference their role as development cooperation providers.The monitoring exercise collects data beyond the scope of the proposed indicator, including additional aspects such as government of development partners’ engagement in planning project/programme evaluations. Measuring the alignment of development partners’ support to country priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of 'respect for each country’s policy space and leadership to establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development'.  In particular, for interventions approved in the year of reference (i.e. most recent behaviour), the assessment measures the extent to which support from other countries and international organizations set exogenous priorities and conditions to partner countries receiving development co-operation that are not reflected in existing country-led priority-setting mechanisms or planning tools.The information collected throughout the indicator provides a 'two-way mirror', providing both a country-level estimate on a country’s existing policy space, and a development partner-level estimate on its degree of alignment with existing results frameworks and priority- setting mechanisms in partner countries where it operates. Data sources:The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting countries in collecting relevant data on a biennial basis through the Global Partnership monitoring framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level.Collection process:(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership's monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, or the Ministry of Planning. (ii) The national coordinator collects inputs from development partners.

The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-led results frameworks reflecting the country’s development priorities and goals. Country results frameworks (CRFs Country results frameworks (CRFs) define a country’s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government’s planning documents. The definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.In practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs.NANA To provide a comprehensive measure on the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and other government-led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions are drawn from government sources –including national, sector and subnational planning tools.For each development intervention of significant size (US$ 100,000 and above) approved during the year of reference, the following dimensions are assessed:- Q1. Whether objectives are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies 0/1- Q2. Share of results (outcome) indicators that are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies %- Q3. Share of results (outcome) indicators that will rely on sources of data provided by existing country-led monitoring systems or national statistical services to track project progress %Aggregated averages per partner country will provide an assessment of the country’s available policy space and leadership. All formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfAggregated averages per development partner will indicate the percentage of alignment with country-led priority setting mechanisms. Formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfNote that data to weight the results by development partner’s actual contributions in terms of development finance is available, if requested by the IAEG SDG / UN Statistical Commission. A global aggregate for the indicator is obtained by averaging the three dimensions of alignment with country’s priorities and goals across all new interventions for the reporting year. Formulas are available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdfWhen aggregating, the size of the project/ intervention is not considered as weight in order to give the same level of importance to the extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools in medium-sized vs. larger projects, as the indicator tries to capture the overall behaviour of development partners in designing new interventions in a given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise over represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. Data collection covered about 80 low and middle-income countries for the 2015-2016 period. The number of countries covered is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond. The estimates for high-income countries are generated taking as a reference their role as development cooperation providers.The monitoring exercise collects data beyond the scope of the proposed indicator, including additional aspects such as government of development partners’ engagement in planning project/programme evaluations. Measuring the alignment of development partners’ support to country priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of 'respect for each country’s policy space and leadership to establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development'.  In particular, for interventions approved in the year of reference (i.e. most recent behaviour), the assessment measures the extent to which support from other countries and international organizations set exogenous priorities and conditions to partner countries receiving development co-operation that are not reflected in existing country-led priority-setting mechanisms or planning tools.The information collected throughout the indicator provides a 'two-way mirror', providing both a country-level estimate on a country’s existing policy space, and a development partner-level estimate on its degree of alignment with existing results frameworks and priority- setting mechanisms in partner countries where it operates. Data sources:The monitoring is a voluntary and country led process. Country governments lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting countries in collecting relevant data on a biennial basis through the Global Partnership monitoring framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level.Collection process:(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership's monitoring exercise, a national coordinator is assigned from the country government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, or the Ministry of Planning. (ii) The national coordinator collects inputs from development partners. The data is submitted to the OECD and UNDP monitoring team and subsequently undergoes a review round with the headquarters offices of development partners. (iii) No adjustments are made to the data after they have undergone the validation process.

Employment Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The working-age population is usually defined as all persons aged 15 and above. For further clarification, see: Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization (2013), available from http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm. No distinction is made between persons employed full time and those working less than full time. Manufacturing sector The manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 4 (2008, the latest) or revision 3 (1990). It refers to industries belonging to sector C in revision 4 or sector D in revision 3.NA (Total employment in manufacturing activities / Total employment in all economic activities) * 100 The characteristics of the data source impact the international comparability of the data, especially in cases where the coverage of the source is less than comprehensive (either in terms of country territory or economic activities). In the absence of a labour force survey (the preferred source of data for this indicator), some countries may use an establishment survey to derive this indicator, but these usually have a minimum establishement size cut-off point and small units which are not officially registered (whether in manufacturing or not) would thus not be included in the survey. Consequently, employment data may be underestimated. Discrepancies can also be caused by differences in the definition of employment or the working:age population. This indicator conveys the contribution of manufacturing in total employment. It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb surplus labour from agricultural and other traditional sectors. However, in developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis has shifted to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting measures, to promote more capital-intensive industries. Data sources:The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household survey with an appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. Where no household survey exists, establishment surveys or some types of administrative records may be used to derive the required data, keeping into account the limitations of these sources in their coverage. Specifically, these sources may exclude some types of establishments, establishments of certain sizes, some economic activities or some geographical areas.Collection process:The ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators. Indicator 9.2.2 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and national statistical offices or through ILO processing of microdatasets of national labour force surveys.UNIDO employment data are collected using General Industrial Statistics Questionnaire which is filled by NSOs and submitted to UNIDO annually.

"SDG_VC_IHR_PSRC","Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex (victims per 100,000 population)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex (victims per 100,000 population) The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year. Intentional homicide In the ICCS intentional homicide is defined as the ‘‘Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury'. This definition contains three elements characterizing the killing of a person as intentional homicide:1. The killing of a person by another person (objective element);2. The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element);3. The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or practices.NANA The indicator is calculated as the total number of victims of intentional homicide recorded in a given year divided by the total resident population in the same year, multiplied by 100,000.In several countries, two separate sets of data on intentional homicide are produced, respectively from criminal justice and public health/civil registration systems. When existing, figures from both data sources are reported. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN Population Division. The ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count of homicide:- Murder- Honour killing- Serious assault leading to death- Death as a result of terrorist activities- Dowry-related killings- Femicide- Infanticide- Voluntary manslaughter- Extrajudicial killings- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officialsFurthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes.The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which provides a definition of ‘Death by assault’ that is very close to the definition of intentional homicide of the ICCS. This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability.Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime). Data sources:Two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b) public health/civil registration. UNODC collects and publishes data from criminal justice systems through its long-lasting annual data collection mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS); WHO collects and publishes data produced by public health/civil registration. The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities.Currently, when national data on homicide are not available from neither of the two types of source above, estimates produced by WHO are used.UNODC and WHO are working together to develop a common approach to produce joint UNODC-WHO homicide data series at country, regional and global level.Collection process:At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely collected by UNODC through the annual UN-CTS data collection. As requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over 130 Member States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that delivers UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites, publications, or other forms of communication are used. Homicide estimates from WHO are currently used when no other source on homicide is available. Once consolidated, data are shared to countries to check their accuracy.When data and related metadata are available, some adjustments are made to data in order to assure compliance with the definition of intentional homicide as provided by the ICCS. National data on types of killings that are considered as intentional homicide by the ICCS, while being classified under a different crime at country level, are added to national figures of intentional homicide. This can be done only when detailed data on such types of killings (e.g. serious assault leading to death, honor killing, etc.) are available.As for UNODC data dissemination policy, data for SDG monitoring will be sent to countries for consultation prior to publication.

This includes: (a) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful or psychologically harmful sexual activity; (b) The use of children in commercial sexual exploitation; (c) The use of children in audio or visual images of child sexual abuse; and (d) Child prostitution, sexual slavery, sexual exploitation in travel and tourism, trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation (within and between countries), sale of children for sexual purposes and forced marriage. Sexual activities are also considered as abuse when committed against a child by another child if the offender is significantly older than the victim or uses power, threat or other means of pressure. Consensual sexual activities between children are not considered as sexual abuse if the children are older than the age limit defined by the State Party.NANA Number of young women and men aged 18-29 years who report having experienced any sexual violence by age 18 divided by the total number of young women and men aged 18-29 years, respectively, in the population multiplied by 100. The availability of comparable data remains a serious challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different study methodologies and designs, definitions of sexual violence, samples and questions to elicit information. Data on the experiences of boys are particularly sparse. A further challenge in this field is underreporting, especially when it comes to reporting on experiences of sexual violence among boys and men. Sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of children's rights violations. Experiences of sexual violence in childhood hinder all aspects of development: physical, psychological/emotional and social. Apart from the physical injuries that can result, researchers have consistently found that the sexual abuse of children is associated with a wide array of mental health consequences and adverse behavioural outcomes in adulthood. The issue is universally relevant and the indicator captures one of the gravest forms of violence against children. The right of children to protection from all forms of violence is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its Optional Protocols. Data sources:Household surveys such as DHS have been collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since the late 1990s.The DHS includes a standard module that captures information on a few specific forms of sexual violence. Respondents are asked whether, at any time in their lives (as children or adults), anyone ever forced them – physically or in any other way – to have sexual intercourse or to perform any other sexual acts against their will. Those responding ‘yes’ to this question are then asked how old they were the first time this happened. It is important to flag that the DHS module was not specifically designed to capture experiences of sexual violence in childhood and while it produces data that can be used to report on 16.2.3, further methodological work is needed to develop standard questions specifically designed to measure child sexual abuse.Collection process:UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).	As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why. More details on the consultation process can be found in the guidance note.

It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations' (Resolution A/RES/62/98) The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. The sub-indicators are: 1.	Forest area annual net change rate 2.	Above-ground biomass stock in forest 3.	Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas 4.	Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan 5.	Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme     National data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under management plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on the country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate using the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under management plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference year 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme are reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly adjusting the figures to remove any double accounting. No dashboard traffic lights are made at country level. The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are summarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, as the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different sub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries. While the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. The definition of SFM by the UN General Assembly contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances – ecological, social and economic – vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. Clearly a simple measure of forest area is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The significance of the five sub-indicators can be briefly explained as follows: 1.	Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-indicator focuses on both the direction of change (whether there is a loss or gain in forest area) and how the change rate is changing over time; the latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are losing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest area loss. 2.	Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the balance between gains in biomass stock due to forest growth and losses due to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and diseases. At country level and over a longer period, sustainable forest management would imply a stable or increasing biomass stock per hectare, while a long-term reduction of biomass stock per hectare would imply either unsustainable management of the forests and degradation or unexpected major losses due to fire, wind, pests or diseases. 3.	The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy for trends in conservation of forest biodiversity as well as cultural and spiritual values of forests and thus a clear indication of the political will to protect and conserve forests. This indicator is related to the CBD Aichi Target 11 which calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas. 4.	The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest area that is under a long term forest management plan. The existence of a documented forest management plan is the basis for long term and sustainable management of the forest resources for a variety of management objectives such as for wood and non-wood forest products, protection of soil and water, biodiversity conservation, social and cultural use, and a combination of two or several of these. An increasing area under forest management plan is therefore an indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management. 5.	The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an independently verified forest management certification scheme. Such certification schemes apply standards that generally are higher than those established by the countries’ own normative frameworks, and compliance is verified by an independent and accredited certifier. An increase in certified forest area therefore provides an additional indication of progress towards sustainable forest management. It should however be noted that there are significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible or affordable certification scheme is in place for that area. Data sources:        Sub-indicators 1 to 4FAO has been monitoring the world's forests at 5 to 10 year intervals since 1946. The Global Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) are now produced every five year. The latest of these assessments, FRA 2020, contains information for 236 countries and territories on about 60 variables related to the extent of forests, their conditions, uses and values for several points in time. Collection process: Data on the sub-indicators are collected periodically (until now every 5 years) by FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) programme. Officially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the country reports for the assessment. Some prepare more than one report as they also report on dependent territories. For the remaining countries and territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO using existing information and a literature search. All data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report through an on-line platform following a standard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time. The on-line platform was used for all data entry, review and quality control.In order to obtain internationally comparable data, countries are requested to provide national categories and definitions, and in case these are different than the FAO categories and definitions, countries are requested to perform a reclassification of national data to correspond to the FAO categories and definitions and to document this step in the country report. Countries are also requested to use interpolation or extrapolation of national data in order to provide estimates for the specific reporting years. Sub-indicator 5Data on forest certification is submitted annually to FAO by the head offices of the respective forest certification scheme. Data include the area certified by each scheme, as well as areas that are double-certified by the two main schemes. That allows for estimating the total certified forest area, adjusted for double certified area. Collection process: Currently, forest certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are included in the data submissions. The latter includes several national/regional certification schemes that have been endorsed according to the PEFC standards. Data reported by the certification bodies and consolidated into estimates of total certified forest area are made available to the countries through an online platform where country officials can view the data that are being submitted. Indicator release: 2021.Q1.G.01 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Goal 15 focuses on managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss. All of these efforts in combination will help ensure that livelihoods are preserved for those that depend directly on forests and other ecosystems, that biodiversity will thrive, and that the benefits of these natural resources will be enjoyed for generations to come.

It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use'. More specifically:- Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.- It includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.- It includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.- It includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters.- It includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters.- It includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not.- It includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.- It includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met.- It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the 'Taungya' system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest. Total land area Total land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.NA Forest area (reference year) / Land area (2015) * 100This indicator can be aggregated to global or regional level by adding all country values globally or in a specific region. Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries. Although the improved access to remote sensing data can help some countries to update their forest area estimates more frequently, estimation of forest area using remote sensing techniques for has certain challenges. In particular they relate to the assessment of land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land cover), and gradual changes, such as forest regrowth, that can require several years to become detectable. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density (e.g. 10-30%) are still difficult to detect at large scale with affordable remote sensing techniques. Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including the provision of goods (wood and non-wood forest products) and services such as habitats for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal protection and soil and water conservation. The indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a country. The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development.Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural sector.Forest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are sustainably managed.The indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator7.1 'Proportion of land covered by forest').

The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.   The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources.

In particular, the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties are to take legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, including for genetic resources that are held by indigenous communities, and benefits arising from the utilization of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. The ABS Clearing-House is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain. The Protocol requires Parties to make information on legislative, administrative and policy measures available to the ABS Clearing-House. Non-Parties are also encouraged to make this information available in the same manner. The goal is to allow users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge to easily find information on the ABS Clearing-House on how to access these resources and knowledge in an organized manner, and all in one convenient location.The International Treaty stipulates that Contracting Parties ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and procedures with their obligations under the International Treaty (Article 4). Under the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing (Articles 10-13), countries grant each other facilitated access to their plant genetic resources, while users of plant genetic material from the Multilateral System are encouraged to share their benefits with the Multilateral System. Such benefits should primarily flow to farmers in developing countries who promote the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. Pursuant to Article 21, the Governing Body adopted the Procedures and operational mechanism to promote compliance and address issues of non-compliance.  Under the monitoring and reporting in the Procedures, each Contracting Party is requested to submit a report on the measures it has taken to implement its obligations under the International Treaty, including the access and benefit-sharing measures.

"SDG_ER_MRN_MARIN","Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas (Exclusive Economic Zones) (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas (Exclusive Economic Zones) (%) The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas. Protected areas Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve- Category Ib: Wilderness area- Category II: National park- Category III: Natural monument or feature- Category IV: Habitat/species management area- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources Designated area The status 'designated' is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). Site contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally criteria  set out in A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Key Biodiversity Areas encompass (a) Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >13,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world’s countries (BirdLife International 2014, Donald et al. 2018); (b) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, of which 853 sites have been identified for 1,483 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, freshwater crustaceans, reef-building corals, conifers, cycads and other taxa; (c) Key Biodiversity Areas identified under an earlier version of the Key Biodiversity Area criteria (Langhammer et al. 2007), including those identified in Ecosystem Hotspot Profiles developed with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. These three subsets are being reassessed using the Global Standard, which unifies these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems (IUCN 2016). This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC & IUCN 2020) and digital polygons for marine Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas). Sites were classified as marine Key Biodiversity Areas by undertaking a spatial overlap between the Key Biodiversity Area polygons and an ocean raster layer (produced from the ‘adm0’ layer from the database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM 2019)), classifying any Key Biodiversity Area as a marine Key Biodiversity Area where it had =5% overlap with the ocean layer (hence some sites were classified as both marine and terrestrial). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is computed as the mean percentage of each Key Biodiversity Area currently recognised that is covered by protected areas.Year of protected area establishment is unknown for ~12% of protected areas in the World Database on Protected Areas, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted. Prior to 2017, the indicator was presented as the percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas completely covered by protected areas. However, it is now presented as the mean % of each Key Biodiversity Area that is covered by protected areas in order to better reflect trends in protected area coverage for countries or regions with few or no Key Biodiversity Areas that are completely covered. Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2019) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (BirdLife International 2019).The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to 'green listing' have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly.Data and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, 'other effective area-based conservation measures', as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et al. 2014). However, the formally agreed definition of an OECM ('A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and, where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socioeconomic, and other locally relevant values') were only agreed in November 2018 and measures are only recently in place for countries to submit OECM data to UNEP-WCMC. OECMs are now collated by UNEP-WCMC in a separate database, the WD-OECM.Regarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused mainly on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). Birds now comprise <50% of the species for which Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified, and as Key Biodiversity Area identification for other taxa and elements of biodiversity proceeds, such bias will become a less important consideration in the future.Key Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or 'irreplaceability') using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).Future developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of marine Key Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of marine vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates). The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term and sustainable use of marine natural resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.The indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010). Data sources:Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. Protected Areas data for sites designated under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO World Heritage Convention are collected through the relevant convention international secretariats. Protected area data are aggregated globally into the World Database on Protected Areas by the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre, according to the mandate for production of the United Nations List of Protected Areas (Deguignet et al. 2014). They are disseminated through Protected Planet, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC 2016).Key Biodiversity Areas are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes, following standard criteria and thresholds. Key Biodiversity Areas data are aggregated into the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas, managed by BirdLife International. Specifically, data on Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are available online at  http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/search and data on Alliance for Zero Extinction sites are available online at https://zeroextinction.org. Both datasets, along with Key Biodiversity Areas identified through other processes, are available through the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas, and along with the World Database on Protected Areas, are also disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning.Collection process:See information under other sections.

This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100. 2G mobile population coverage Mobile networks with access to data communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 Kbit/s. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of such services. 3G population coverage Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100.

LTE population coverage Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by the previously mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX coverage. The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network, broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100. Some countries have difficulty calculating overall mobile-cellular population coverage. In some cases, data refer only to the operator with the largest coverage, and this may understate the true coverage. The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed when fixed-telephone networks : often limited to urban and highly populated areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure.While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly voice-based) services, higher-speed networks (3G and LTE) provide increasingly high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its increasing amount of information, content, services, and applications. Mobile networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology) that operators must achieve. Data sources:This indicator is based on an internationally agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014).ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology Ministries, who collect the data from Internet service providers.Collection process:ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology Ministries, who collect the data from Internet service providers.

"SDG_IT_USE_ii99","Internet users per 100 inhabitants","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Internet users per 100 inhabitants The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is defined as the proportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location in the last three months. Internet The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed or mobile network.NANA For countries that collect data on this indicator through an official survey, this indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope individuals using the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months by the total number of in-scope individuals. For countries that have not carried out a survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based on the number of Internet subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators (GNI per capita) and on the time series data. While the data on the percentage of individuals using the Internet are very reliable for countries that have collected the data through official household surveys, they are less reliable in cases where the number of Internet users is estimated by ITU. ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through official surveys and the number of countries with official data for this indicator is increasing. The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to access public information, which is a relevant means to protect fundamental freedoms. The number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last decade and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy makers and others to measure the development of the information society and the growth of Internet content – including user-generated content – provides access to increasing amounts of information and services.Despite growth in networks, services and applications, information and communication technology (ICT) access and use is still far from equally distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the potential of the Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet use as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet –such as age, sex, education level or labour force status – can help identify digital divides in individuals using the Internet. This information can contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.The proportion of individuals using the Internet is an established indicator and also one of the three ICT-related Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators (for Target 8F). It is part of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). It is also included in the ITU ICT Development Index, and thus considered a key metric for international comparisons of ICT developments. Data sources:The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is based on an internationally agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). Data on individuals using the Internet are collected through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO). In this questionnaire ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years’ data and situation of the country for other related indicators (ICT and economic).For most developed and an increasing number of developing countries, percentage of individuals using the Internet data are based on methodologically sound household surveys conducted by national statistical agencies. If the NSO has not collected Internet user statistics, then ITU estimates the percentage of individuals using the Internet.Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.Some countries conduct a household survey where the question on Internet use is included every year. For others, the frequency is every two or three years. Overall, the indicator is available for 100 countries at least from one survey in the years 2011-2014.ITU makes the indicator available for each year for 200 economies by using survey data and estimates for almost all countries of the world.Collection process:Data on individuals using the Internet are collected through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO).

Gross value added and GDP The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units' total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015.NANA MVA proportion to GDP = MVA/GDP*100.MVA per capita = MVA/population Differences may appear due to different versions of System of National Accounts (SNA) or ISIC revisions used by countries. MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country's national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a country's level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial development. Data sources:UNIDO maintains MVA database. Figures for updates are obtained from national account estimates produced by UN Statistics Division (UNSD) and from official publications.Collection process:The MVA and GDP country data are collected through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ) sent by UNSD.

The indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO2 emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing value added (MVA).                CO2 emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of CO2 per USD constant 2010 PPP GDP. CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are measured in kilogrammes of CO2 equivalent per unit of MVA in constant 2015 USD. Total CO2 emissions Total CO2 emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy consumption data for all sectors.CO2 emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by industry is not included here but reported under transport):- Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];- Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;- Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];- Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];- Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];- Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];- Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];- Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];- Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper)  [ISIC Division 16];- Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];- Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics). CO2 emissions need to be estimated based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies (IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories). The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed energy statistics definitions and estimates CO2 emissions based on the IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventories Tier 1 methodology, producing internationally comparable CO2 emissions data for over 150 countries and regions. Gross value added (GVA) The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units’ total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the total CO2 emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015. CO2 emissions from fuel combustion are estimated based on energy consumption and on the IPCC Guidelines.The total intensity of the economy is defined as the ratio of total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and GDP.The sectoral intensity is defined as CO2 emission from manufacturing (in physical measurement unit such as tonnes) divided by manufacturing value added (MVA) in constant 2015 USD.CO2 emissions per unit of value added = CO2 emission from manufacturing (in kg) / MVA (constant USD) Estimation of CO2 emission data is not systematized in many countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include statistical offices, Energy Ministries, Environment agencies, among others. Energy consumption data and value added data are coming from different data sources which may raise some consistency issues. The indicator CO2 emissions per unit of value added represents the amount of emissions from fuel combustion produced by an economic activity, per unit of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, in the structure of the manufacturing sector, in the energy efficiency of production technologies in each sub-sector, and in the economic value of the various output. Manufacturing industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. CO2 emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from the manufacturing processes. Data sources:Data on total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, also disaggregated by sector, are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA) database (IEA CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion:https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-2019). The IEA produces the indicator on total CO2 emissions/GDP, based on secondary sources for GDP (OECD National Accounts and World Bank Development indicators).UNIDO maintains MVA database. Figures for updates are obtained from national account estimates produced by UN Statistics Division (UNSD).Collection process:Energy data are collected at the national level according to harmonised international definitions and questionnaires, as described in the UN International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/).The estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion are calculated by the IEA based on the IEA energy data and the default methods and emission factors from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/). More information on methodologies from the IEA is available at: http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdfThe MVA and GDP country data are collected through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ) sent by UNSD.

"SDG_EN_LND_SLUM","Proportion of urban population living in slums (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of urban population living in slums (%) The nature of the housing sector with its institutions, laws and regulations, is one that touches every single aspect of the economy of a country and has interface with practically every social development sector. People living in adequate homes have better health, higher chances to improve their human capital and seize the opportunities available in urban contexts. At the same time, a housing sector that performs well acts as a ‘development multiplier’ benefiting complementary industries, contributing to economic development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction. Broadly, for every job in the house-building sector, an additional 1.5 to 2 jobs are generally created in the construction materials and other input industries. The contributions of housing to urban prosperity are also evident. The UN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative reveals indicates that inadequate housing has negative effects on several other dimensions of urban prosperity. Urban contexts with housing conditions below average experience poorer equity and inclusion, reduced urban safety and livelihood opportunities, and have neglected connectivity and provision of public space.Inadequate housing thus remains very much a global urban sustainability challenge but also development opportunity. At the same time, the thematic area of ‘adequate housing’ and especially the term ‘slums’ - are often highly politicized. More nuanced definitions of these terms would enable and support a more robust and measured debate, greater engagement by all key stakeholders and the development of specific recommendations for application within each context and place.  There are a number of interrelated terms that must be grappled with when considering an indicator for the SDG Target 11.1. They include inadequate housing and housing affordability, informal settlements and slums. Housing affordability One of the most daunting challenges of urbanization globally has been the provision of adequate housing that people can afford. Findings from the UN Global Sample of Cities  show that people across all types of urban centres are not able to afford home ownership or even the cost of rental housing. In low-income countries for example, households need to save the equivalent of nearly eight times their annual household income in order to be able to afford the price of a standard house in their town or city. If they rent, households have to commit more than 25 per cent of their monthly income to rent payments.  The affordability issue is affecting the developing and developed worlds alike. In Latin America, high house price-to-income ratio and inaccessible housing finance compel households to resort to informal solutions without the benefits of planning and safety regulations. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, less than 10 per cent of households are able to afford a mortgage for even the cheapest newly built house. In fact, African households face 55 per cent higher housing costs relative to their per capita GDP than in other regions.  In many European countries, families, especially the youth, are severely cost burdened and have much less to spend on other necessities such as food, health, transport and clothing. In extreme circumstances, households are forced to leave their accommodation because of the inability to pay. The current migration crisis has worsened housing conditions in the region, a trend that seems set to continue in the next few years. Inadequate housing, informal settlements and slums Today, an estimated 1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing globally, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements . This means that about one in four people in cities live in conditions that harm their health, safety, prosperity and opportunities. Lack of access to basic services is a common constraint in informal settlements and slums: worldwide 2.4 billion people live without improved sanitation and 2 billion are affected by water stress. In spite of a decrease from 39 to 30 per cent of urban population living in slums between 2000 and 2014, absolute numbers continue to grow: currently, one quarter of the world’s urban population is estimated to live in slums, 881 million urban residents as opposed to 792 million in 2000.  Young women- and children-headed households are often the most vulnerable to inadequate housing conditions. Homelessness is also a growing challenge and it is estimated that more than 100 million people worldwide are homeless. Slums represent one of the most extreme forms of deprivation and exclusion and remain a critical factor for the persistence of poverty and exclusion in the world – indeed a challenge for sustainable and inclusive urbanization. Research shows that other forms of urban poverty in the form of informal settlements increasingly become a worldwide phenomenon found also in the developed world.At the same time, not all people who live in inadequate housing live in slums but are nonetheless living in very substandard conditions in the urban contexts in which they are situated. The nature of these unsatisfactory living conditions must be captured and better represented in the global, country and city-level data to ensure a more robust picture of inadequate housing is documented. In light of this, the following definitions are proposed. Slums  An expert group meeting was convened in 2002 by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D. The agreed definition classified a ‘slum household’ as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following ‘household deprivations’:1.	Lack of access to improved water source,2.	Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3.	Lack of sufficient living area, 4.	Lack of housing durability and,5.	Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term ‘slum dweller’ refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes. These five components –all derived from the adequate housing’s definition have been used ever since for reporting and tracking of the MDGs, as the primary or secondary data measured to determine the number of slum dwellers living in developing countries. They were also the basis to establish the successful achievement of MDG Target 7.D. For each component, the experts agreed with the following sub-definitions: 1) Access to improved water – A household is considered to have access to improved drinking water if the household members use a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters’ contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and, protected dug well.2) Access to improved sanitation – A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation if household members have access to a facility with an excreta disposal system that hygienically separates human waste from human contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform, which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.3) Sufficient living area /overcrowding– A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room.  Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally, housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of children under five per room may also be viable. However, the number of persons per room has been shown to correlate with adverse health risks and is more commonly collected through household survey. . UN-Habitat believes that the definition as it stands does not reflect the practical experience of overcrowding and as noted below, is proposing an alternative. 4) Structural quality/durability of dwellings – A house is considered as ‘durable’ if it is built on a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity. The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings: permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor; compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way: rail, highway, airport, power lines).5) Security of tenure – Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one’s home with security, peace and dignity (A/HRC/25/54). Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions. Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into the computation of the people living in slums. The indicator considers two components to be computed as follows:a)	Percentage of people living in Slum/Informal Settlements households (SISH):   = 100 * [ Number of people living in SISH / Urgane-City population]b)	Percentage of people living in Inadequate housing households (IHH):   = 100 * [ Number of people living in IHH / Urgane-City population]        The unit of measurements for all these indicators will be %. Currently, the data for this indicator is already being reported in nearly all developing countries on what refers to slums and informal settlements, and in some countries for what refers to expenditure on housing (for inadequate housing). The SDG indicator 11.1.1 will therefore contribute to report on a broader spectrum of inadequate housing conditions affecting households in all countries. As with all indicators, there are some  potential challenges and limitations. Some of these are outlined below.- Difficulties to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to deteriorated housing conditions, often due to political or economic considerations.- Lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all components required by Indicator 11.1.1, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of deteriorated housing units.- The complicated relation between security of tenure with land and property makes it a difficult, but vital, aspect to include in the different surveys, and thus, to measure and monitor. - Indicator 11.1.1 does not capture homelessness.- Many countries still have limited capacities for data collection, management and analysis, their update and monitoring. These are key to ensure national and global data consistency. As seen in Table 1 below, most of the criteria for defining slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing overlap. The three criteria of informal settlements are essentially captured in the definition of slums, which sustains the combination of both (slums/informal settlements). Both aspects of slums and informal settlements are therefore combined into one component of the indicator, providing some continuity with what was captured under MDG 7. At a later stage, a composite index will be developed that will incorporate all measures (combining slum/informal settlements and inadequate housing) and provide one estimate.  The second component of the indicator is on inadequate housing. From the seven criteria of adequate housing, the three that are not covered by slums / informal settlements are affordability, accessibility and cultural adequacy. However, affordability is the most relevant and easier to measure.   In this regard, housing affordability is not only a key housing adequacy criterion, but is a suitable means of measuring inadequate housing in a more encompassing manner, as it remains a global challenge across different countries and income levels, with strong negative impact on urban inequality. The underlying principle is that household financial costs associated with housing should not threaten or compromise the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs such as, food, education, access to health care, transport, etc. Based on the existing method and data of UN-Habitat’s Urban Indicators Program (1996-2006), unaffordability is currently measured as the net monthly expenditure on housing cost that exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household.Table 2 details the proposed definition of Slum/Informal Settlements and Inadequate Housing as well as the respective measurements.Table 2 – Definition and measurement criteria for slums, informal settlements and inadequate housingA. Slums / Informal Settlements	DEFINITION: As adopted in the MDG, slum households are households whose members suffer one or more of the following ‘household deprivations’: 1) Lack of access to improved water source, 2) Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3) Lack of sufficient living area, 4) Lack of housing durability and, 5) Lack of security of tenure.MEASUREMENT :Security of Tenure:- Proportion of households with formal title deeds to both land and residence.- Proportion of households with formal title deeds to either one of land or residence.- Proportion of households with agreements or any document as a proof of a tenure arrangement.Access to improved water sources:- Proportion of households whose members have access to improved drinking water sources (i.e. piped in water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe service; protected spring; rain water collection; bottled water if secondary source is also improved; bore hole/tube well; and protected dug well). Access to improved sanitation facilities:- Proportion of households whose members have access to improved sanitation facilities (i.e. pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform that covers the pit entirely; composting toilets/latrines).Structural quality of Housing and location: - Proportion of households residing on or near a hazardous site. The following locations should be considered:   -housing in geologically hazardous zones (landslide/earthquake and flood areas);   -housing on or under garbage mountains;   -housing around high-industrial pollution areas;   -housing around other unprotected high-risk zones (e.g. railroads, airports, energy transmission lines).Structural quality of the housing and permanency of the structure:- Proportion of households living in temporary and/or dilapidated structures. The following factors should be considered when placing a housing unit in these categories:    -quality of construction (e.g. materials used for wall, floor and roof);   -compliance with local building codes, standards and bylaws.Sufficient living area: - Proportion of households in which not more than three people share the same habitable room.B. Inadequate housing 	DEFINITION: Proposed to complement the slums/informal settlements measuring affordability of housing at the global level. A housing is considered inadequate if it is not affordable to the household, i.e. the net monthly expenditure on its cost exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household.	MEASUREMENT: Inadequate housing: - Proportion of households with net monthly expenditure on housing exceeding 30% of the total monthly income of the household. Data Sources:Data for the slum/informal settlements components of the indicator can be computed from Census and national household surveys, including DHS and MICS. Data for the inadequate housing component can be computed through income and household surveys that capture housing expenditures.As per all the agreed Agenda 2030’s goals and targets, to measure the achievement of this indicator will require the mobilisation of means required to efficiently monitor them, calling for revitalised partnerships with the participation of all countries, all stakeholders and all communities concerned.For primary reporting, national data providers (especially the Statistical agencies) will play an important role generating the primary data through census and surveys. Regional and global estimates will be derived from national figures with appropriate disaggregation. Specialized tools will be developed and agreed upon with local and international stakeholders. Quality assurance on the use of the tools, analysis and reporting will be deployed regionally and globally, to ensure that standards are uniform and that definitions are universally applied.

The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage should refer to LTE, broadband (3G) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular technologies. Aalue added of an industry The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept that refers to the given industry’s net output derived from the difference of gross output and intermediate consumption. Manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3 (1990) or Revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to sector D in revision 3 or sector C in Revision 4. Technology classification Technology classification is based on research and development (R&D) expenditure relative to value added otherwise referred as R&D intensity.  Data for R&D intensity are presented in a report (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) published by the OECD in 2016, which also proposes a taxonomy for industry groups with different ranges of R&D expenditure relative to their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high technology sectors also in new paper are primarily represented by manufacturing industries. Value added of manufacturing (MVA) MVA is the value added of manufacturing industry, which is Section C of ISIC Rev.4, and Section D of ISIC Rev.3.  The indicator is calculated as the share of the sum of the value added from MHT economic activities to MVA.        (Sum of value added in MHT economic activities / MVA) * 100 Value added by economic activity should be reported at least at 3-digit ISIC for compiling MHT values. Industrial development generally entails a structural transition from resource-based and low technology activities to MHT activities. A modern, highly complex production structure offers better opportunities for skills development and technological innovation. MHT activities are also the high value addition industries of manufacturing with higher technological intensity and labour productivity. Increasing the share of MHT sectors also reflects the impact of innovation. Data sources:Data can be found in UNIDO INDSTAT4 Database by ISIC Revision 3 and ISIC Revision 4 respectively.Collection process:Data are collected using General Industrial Statistics Questionnaire which is filled by NSOs and submitted to UNIDO annually.

"SDG_EN_REF_WASCOL","Municipal Solid Waste collection coverage, by cities (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Municipal Solid Waste collection coverage, by cities (%) SDG 11.6 targets an improved environmental performance of cities and SDG indicator 11.6.1 measures the progress of the performance of a city’s municipal solid waste management. It quantifies the parameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section).a)	Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day)b)	Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day)c)	Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%)d)	Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day)e)	MSW compositionIt is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with access to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of waste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste collection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste ‘collected’ from households into the surrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household has waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is possible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but the amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low. Although part (c)  is covered by SDG 1 ('End poverty in all its forms everywhere'), under target 1.4 and SDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on poor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household questionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to ‘basic’ MSW collection services. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household survey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, many cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata distinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and report on part (c). Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Municipal Solid Waste includes waste generated from: households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes bulky waste (e.g. white goods, old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g. waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste. The definition excludes waste from municipal sewage network and treatment, municipal construction and demolition waste. Generation of municipal Solid Waste Total MSW Generated is the sum of the amount of municipal waste collected plus the estimated amount of municipal waste from areas not served by a municipal waste collection service. Collection of municipal Solid Waste Total MSW Collected refers to the amount of municipal waste collected by or on behalf of municipalities, as well as municipal waste collected by the private sector. It includes mixed waste, and fractions collected separately for recovery operations (through door-to-door collection and/or through voluntary deposits). The numerator of this indicator is ‘total MSW collected and managed in controlled facilities(tonnes/day)’ and the denominator is ‘total municipal solid waste generated by the city (tonnes/day’).        The MSW generated by the city is either collected or uncollected, and the collected MSW is delivered to recovery or disposal facilities. Recovery facilities generate residues that are sent to disposal facilities. In many cities, recyclables are also recovered from disposal facilities and brought back into the recycling value chain. Recovery or disposal facilities can be categorized as either ‘controlled’ or ‘uncontrolled’ depending on the operational measures put in place to minimize the environmental, health and safety impacts from the facilities. When both recovery and disposal occur within the same facility, it is necessary to evaluate the control level of the recovery and disposal operations independently of each other.        Data pointsThe data points required to calculate SDG indicator 11.6.1 include:A.	Total MSW generated by the cityB.	Total MSW collected C.	Total MSW managed in controlled facilities These data also help cities to identify the proportion of MSW that remains uncollected.A.	Total MSW generated by the cityFor cities that do not have reliable data on MSW generation, it can be estimated through the multiplication of the total population and per capita MSW generation from the household. Detailed methodology for this is provided in Steps 1, 2 and 3 in Waste Wise Cities Tool – Step by Step Guide to Assess a City’s MSMW Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring (UN-Habitat, 2020).  B.	Total MSW collectedWhen measuring total MSW collected, there is a risk of double counting, concerning the residue or rejects from recovery facilities and the amount of waste recovered from disposal facilities going to recovery. Therefore, these amounts need to be deducted from the sum of waste received by both recovery and disposal facilities. It is assumed residue of recovery facilities is going to disposal facilities or other recovery facilities.C.	Total MSW managed in controlled facilitiesMSW Managed in Controlled Facilities is MSW collected and transported to recovery and disposal facilities with basic control or above according to the control ladder. Steps 4 and 5 in Waste Wise Cities Tool – Step by Step Guide to Assess a City’s MSMW Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring provide detailed methodology on how to collect this data if not available.Additional data pointsThe SDG indicator 11.6.1 assessment provides information for the calculation of three more very relevant MSW management data points. Although they are not necessary for the calculation of the SDG indicator, these figures are of interest for city authorities:- Per capita MSW generation rate- MSW composition- Uncollected wasteD.	Per capita MSW generation rateA very relevant parameter that can be derived from the previous formula is the 'total per capita MSW generation rate'. Steps 2 and 3 in Waste Wise Cities Tool – Step by Step Guide to Assess a City’s MSMW Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring explain how to calculate this through waste sampling from households, if no reliable or updated data is available. Particularly for cities where a large amount of MSW remains uncollected, it is recommended to sample the waste from households, as provided by the Waste Wise Cities Tool.E.	MSW CompositionThe SDG indicator 11.6.1 assessment determines the waste composition at the point of generation (i.e. households) and at the point of disposal. Understanding MSW composition at the beginning and end of the MSW service chain is a useful exercise for several reasons; Understanding composition helps identifying how the existing recovery/recycling sector is functioning, it enables further recovery facilities to be identified and planned, and overall assists triangulation (i.e. test validity and reliability) of data collected.Note that MSW also includes waste from non-household sources. In Step 3 of Waste Wise Cities Tool – Step by Step Guide to Assess a City’s MSMW Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring, the quantities of MSW generated from commercial and institutional sources, as well as from public spaces, is estimated. However, specific composition analysis on MSW from non-household sources is beyond the scope of this tool as it is complex and resource intensive.F.	Total uncollected wasteTotal uncollected MSW can be calculated by subtracting the total MSW regularly collected from the total MSW generated. Collection of data for the indicator is very much possible as demonstrated by pilot data collection using UN-Habitat’s Waste Wise Cities Tool in Mombasa (see flow diagram), but continuous training and capacity development for tool application at city level will be required to strengthen the global waste statistics and improve its data quality. In general, developed countries have good Municipal solid waste data collection systems. Some of the best available data for middle and low income countries is available from UNSD, though it is relatively sporadic.  In countries and cities where data availability is particularly challenging, household surveys and other complimentary surveys are being conducted for the estimation of municipal waste generation per capita. Also, the collection of the data, such as the amount of waste managed in controlled facilities, remains a challenge for many national and local governments. The judgement on the adequacy of treatment and disposal of all the waste management facilities, including composting, recycling, incineration facilities in a city, requires high level of technical capacity and large investment in human resources. Urban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste that must be collected regularly, recycled or treated and disposed properly in order to maintain healthy and sanitary living conditions. Many cities are increasingly facing solid waste management challenges due to rapid urbanization, lack of technical and financial capacity or low policy priority. In addition, the higher the income level of a city, the greater the amount of the solid waste produced. Therefore, the economic growth to be experienced in the developing and emerging countries will pose greater challenges in solid waste management to local governments in the next decades.Adverse environmental impact of uncollected waste in a city is significant. Uncollected solid waste can end up in drains leading to blocked drainages and cause unsanitary conditions that have a direct health impact on residents. Open burning of uncollected waste produces pollutants that are highly damaging locally and globally. Vectors such as mosquitos usually breed in blocked drainages and blocked drainage contributes to the cause of flooding. In 2015, the Global Waste Management Outlook estimated that at least 2 billion people do not have access to regular waste collection. This is particularly worse in informal settlements and the UN-Habitat’s report Solid Waste Management in World Cities published in 2010 estimated only 5% of waste in squatter areas is regularly collected.  The global scale of urbanization and economic growth are creating a potential 'time-bomb' regarding the waste we generate in the world. If not addressed now, the significant negative impact on human health and the environment will be felt by nations at all levels of development. An estimated 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) were generated in 2016, and this number is expected to grow to 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario (Worldbank, 2018). Uncontrolled disposal sites are already a major source of Green House Gases (GHG), and if we continue on the current path the waste sector, particularly food waste, is predicted to account for 8-10% of global anthropogenic GHG emission by 2025. Additionally, every year at least 8 million tonnes of plastic find its way into the world’s oceans (Jambeck et al., 2015).There is a need for SDG indicator 11.6.1 monitoring as it provides critical information for cities and countries to establish better waste and resource management strategies. Reliable data and information on MSW generation and management is limited globally, especially in low- and middle-income country settings where waste data is often produced based on international estimates, without having been validated in the local context. Many developing and transitional country cities still have an active informal sector and micro-enterprise recycling, reuse and repair; often achieve recycling and recovery rates comparable to those in developed countries, resulting in savings to the waste management budget of the cities. There is a major opportunity for the city to build on these existing recycling systems, reducing some unsustainable practices and enhancing them to protect and develop people’s livelihoods, and to reduce still further the costs to the city of managing the residual wastes. The formal and informal sectors need to work together, for the benefit of both. Promoting this indicator also can help formalization of the informal sector in the process of increasing the portion of ‘solid waste with adequate discharge’. A global data collection and publication system through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics has collected data on MSW collection and treatment for about 20 years. The Questionnaire has been sent to more than 160 countries, covering both national and city levels. However, the response rate for the UNSD/UNEP questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, especially for developing countries. While efforts will continue to collect data from National Statistical Offices and Ministries of Environment at the national level, it is also critical to improve the availability and accessibility of waste statistics and increase training for collection of data and capacity development at the national and sub-national levels.This paucity of evidence-based data hinders the development of waste management strategies and constrains investment decision-making in infrastructure and service expansion, leading to many countries having insufficient or absent MSW management services. Poor MSW collection and management trigger severe threats to public health and pollute air and water. Furthermore, uncollected and mismanaged waste is the main source of marine plastic pollution.The indicator 11.6.1 will also promote Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM). An integrated solid waste management system is strongly connected to three dimensions: urban environmental health, the environment and resource management. Moreover, a regular solid waste management strategy is a clear indicator of the effectiveness of a municipal administration. Good waste governance that is inclusive, financially sustainable and based on sound institutions is one of the key challenges of the 21st century, and one of the key responsibilities of a city government.SDG indicator 11.6.1 quantifies parameters that will help cities and countries to better manage resources, mitigate and prevent environmental pollution, create business, employment and livelihood opportunities, and shift towards a circular economy. The methodology to monitor SDG indicator 11.6.1 provides guidelines for ladders for MSW collection services and control level of waste management facilities and aims to bring standardization around MSW data points.The indicator 11.6.1 has strong linkages to other SDG indicators such as 6.3.1 (proportion of wastewater safely treated), 12.3.1 (food waste), 12.4.2 (Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated and by type of treatment) and 12.5.1 (National recycling rate).  UN-Habitat has also developed an additional document Waste Wise Cities Tool - Step by Step Guide to Assess a City’s MSWM Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring which provides detailed methodology for data collection if not available. Data sources:Countries and cities/municipalities that have the data already are recommended to answer the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics to provide the data related to SDG 11.6.1. For countries and municipalities/cities that do not have the data, it is recommended to apply UN-Habitat’s Waste Wise Cities Tool – Step by Step Guide to Assess a City’s MSMW Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring. Collection process:It is recommended to establish a system where local or municipal governments collect SDG 11.6.1 data utilizing Waste Wise Cities Tool, then the data aggregated by the ministries and agencies in charge of environmental protection. These collected data should be reported to UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics every two years from national statistical offices of countries. Currently the response rate for the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, especially for developing countries. Countries may report their data to UNSD via the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section) following application of the methods specified in this metadata template. UNSD engages in an extensive data validation process including automated checks, and liaisons with the country’s NSO or Ministry of Environment.

"SDG_NV_IND_SSIS","Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added (%) Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called 'small-scale industries', defined here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class.Proportion of 'small-scale industries' in total industry value added represents an indicator calculating the share of manufacturing value added of small-scale manufacturing enterprises in the total manufacturing value added. Enterprise  International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011) define an enterprise as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts. Establishment  An establishment is defined as an enterprise or part of an enterprise that is situated in a single location and in which only a single productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added. An establishment can be defined ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single ownership or control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly one, kind of economic activity at a single physical location. Mines, factories and workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in industrial inquiries, particularly in manufacturing.Although the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If a secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in which the principal activity takes place. Small-sized businesses In the case of most small-sized businesses, the enterprise and the establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled.  The proportion of 'small-scale industries' in total value added is an indicator calculated as a share of value added for small-scale manufacturing enterprises in total manufacturing value added:        (Manufacturing value added of small-scale inductries / Total manufacturing value added) * 100 The main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by country indicating that data are obtained from different target populations. Data of one country are not comparable to another. The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote 'small-scale industries'. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for compilation purposes. In this context, UNIDO proposes that all countries compile the employment and value added data by a size class of 'small-scale industries' as with less than 20 persons employed. From such data, an internationally comparable data on the share of 'small-scale industries' in total could be derived. Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. 'Small-scale industries' can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very high. 'Small-scale industries' are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc. Data sources:Data are collected primary from national sources, from official publications and official web-sites, and from OECD (Structural and Demographic Business Statistics) and EUROSTAT (Structural Business Statistics database). Collection process:Countries were contacted to provide information on data availability for monitoring small-scale industrial enterprises. The data come mostly from annual industrial surveys, where value added is disaggregated by size classes given in terms of number of employees and from surveys focusing particularly on small enterprises, or small and medium enterprises in general.

"SDG_SN_ITK_DEFCN","Number of undernourish people (millions)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Number of undernourish people (millions) The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (French: pourcentage de sous-alimentation; Spanish: porcentaje de sub-alimentaciÃ³n; Italian: prevalenza di sotto-alimentazione) is an estimate of the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage. Undernourishment Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements.             Though strictly related, 'undernourishment' as defined here is different from the physical conditions of 'malnutrition' and 'undernutrition' as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, alimentaciÃ³n, or alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutriciÃ³n or nutrizione, in the name of the indicator. A more appropriate expression in English that would render the precise meaning of the indicator might have been 'prevalence of under-feeding' but by now the term 'undernourishment' has long been associated with the indicator.             While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished.NANA The indicator is computed at the population level. To this aim, the population is represented by an 'average' individual for which a probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy intake levels is modelled through a parametric probability density function (pdf).       Once the pdf is characterized, the indicator is obtained as the cumulative probability that daily habitual dietary energy intakes (x) are below the lower bound of the range of normal dietary energy requirements for that representative, or average individual (MDER)              See https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-01-01.pdf for detailed methodology. Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic over time, of the same individual.             The model based approach to estimate the PoU developed by FAO integrates information that is available with sufficient regularity from different sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor progress towards reducing global hunger.             Further specific consideration             1.	Feasibility       Estimation of PoU at national level has been feasible for most countries in the world since 1999. In the worst case scenario, when no data on food consumption was available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC) from Food Balance Sheets (FBS), an indirect estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) based on information on the country's GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country's Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) based on the UN Population Division's World Population Prospects data.             2.	Reliability       Reliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the estimation of the model's parameters.       DEC could be estimated either from survey data or from food balances. Neither source is devoid of problems. When comparing estimates of national DEC from FBS and from surveys, differences are frequently noted.       DEC estimates from survey data can be affected by systematic measurement errors due to under-reporting of food consumption, or to incomplete recording of all food consumption sources. Recent research shows that a negative bias of up to more than 850 kcal can be induced on the estimated daily per capita caloric consumption can be induced by the type of food consumption module chosen to capture the data at the household level. (See De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf ). A detailed analysis of a recent Household Budget Survey in Brazil revealed how food provided for free through the school meals program and consumed by children while at school, had not been accounted among the sources of household food consumption, accounting for a downward bias of the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption of 674 kcal. (See Borlizzi, Cafiero & Del Grossi, forthcoming.)       DEC estimates from Food Balance Sheets can also be affected by errors, though it is difficult to establish the direction of induced bias. As average food availability is a residual in the FBS method, any errors in reported production, trade, and stocks might affect the estimates of national food availability. Moreover, errors might be induced by the difficulty in properly accounting for all forms of food commodity utilization. To the extent that all these errors are uncorrelated, though, the impact on the estimated average food consumption will be lower than each of the errors, considered separately, might imply. Nevertheless, considering how problematic it is to precisely account for variations in national reserves of food commodities, for which official data may be unreliable, it is recognized that the estimated annual stock variation is prone to considerable uncertainty that would be transferred to the estimated DEC in each given year.       To limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented estimates of PoU at national level as three-year averages, on the presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average over three consecutive years.       Survey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness. As described in the section of metadata on the method of computation, unless obtained from high quality individual dietary intake surveys, data needs to be treated to reduce the likely upward bias in the estimates of the CV that would be induced by the spurious variability due to errors in measuring individual habitual dietary energy intake.             3.	Comparability       If the same method of computation is used, comparability across time and space is relatively high, with the only potential cause of inhomogeneity found in the different quality of the background data.             4.	Limitations       Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of uncertainty associated with estimates of each of the parameters in the model, the precision of the PoU estimates is generally low. Even though it is not possible to compute theoretical Margins of Error (MoE) for PoU estimates, these would very likely exceed plus or minus 2.5% in most cases. For this reason, FAO publishes national level PoU estimates only when they are larger than 2.5%. This also suggests that 2.5% is the lowest feasible target that can be set for the PoU indicator, a value that is unsatisfactorily large when the ambition is to fully eradicate the scourge of hunger.       If no survey is available that collects food consumption data and that is representative at subnational level, the indicator can only be computed at national level. The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999. It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households' ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time.             The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimated for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe condition of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal that aims at reducing hunger. Data sources: The ideal source of data to estimate the PoU would be a carefully designed and skillfully conducted individual dietary intake survey, in which actual daily food consumption, together with heights and weights for each surveyed individual, are repeatedly measured on a sample that is representative of the target population. Due to their cost, however, such surveys are rare.            In principle, a well-designed household survey that collects information on food acquisitions might be sufficient to inform a reliable estimate of the Prevalence of Undernourishment in a population, at a reasonable cost and with the necessary periodicity to inform the SDG monitoring process, provided that:             a)	All sources of food consumption for all members of the households are properly accounted for, including, in particular, food that is consumed away from home;       b)	Sufficient information is available to convert the data on food consumption or on food expenditures into their contribution to dietary energy intake;       c)	The proper methods to compute the PoU are used, to control for excess variability in the estimated levels of habitual food consumption across households, allowing for the presence on normal variability in the distribution of food consumption across individuals, induced by the differences in energy requirements of the members of the population.             Examples of surveys that could be considered for this purpose include surveys conducted to compute economic statistics and conduct poverty assessments, such as Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, Household Budget Surveys and Living Standard Measurement Surveys.             In practice, however, it is often impossible, and not advisable, to rely only on data collected through a household survey, as the information needed to estimate the four parameters of the PoU model is either missing or imprecise.             Household Survey food consumption data often must be integrated by       a) Data on the demographic structure of the population of interest by sex and age;       b) Data or information on the median height of individuals in each sex and age class;       c) Data on the distribution of physical activity levels in the population;       d) Alternative data on the total amounts of food available for human consumption, to correct for biases in the estimate of the national average daily dietary energy consumption in the population.             Data for a), b) and c) could be available through the same multipurpose survey that provides food consumption data, but are more likely available from other sources, such as National Demographic and Health Surveys (for a) and b) ) and Time Use Surveys (for c) ).             Correcting for bias in the estimated average daily dietary energy consumption might need to be based on alternative sources on food consumption, such as aggregate food supply and utilization accounts and food balance sheets.             To inform its estimate of PoU at national, regional and global level, in addition to all household surveys for which it is possible to obtain micro data on food consumption, FAO relies on:       a) UN Population Division's World Population Prospects (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/), which provide updated estimates of the structures of the national population by sex and age every two years for most countries in the world;       b) FAO Food Balance Sheets (http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E), which provides updated estimates of the national availability of food every year for most countries in the world.            Micro data from household surveys that collect food consumption data are sourced by FAO directly through the National Statistical Agencies' websites, or through specific bilateral agreements.             Collection process: Official information on food commodity production, trade and utilization used by FAO to compile Food Balance Sheets is provided mainly by Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture. FAO sends out a data collection questionnaire every year to an identified focal point.               Microdata of household surveys are generally owned and provided by National Statistical Agencies. When available, data is sourced by FAO directly through the NSA' website. In several cases, when microdata is not available in the public domain, bilateral agreements have been signed, usually in the contexts of technical assistance and capacity development programs.               Data on the population size and structure for all monitored countries is obtained from the UN Population Division's World Population Prospects.

International cooperation and capacity-building support 'International cooperation and capacity-building support' implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries ('bilateral ODA') and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies-with the pure purpose of export promotion-is excluded (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Developing countries 'Developing countries' refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm). This limits the scope of reporting to those countries receiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going forward. Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies.  The indicator is computed as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related ODA that is included in the government budget, i.e. the amount of water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget divided by the total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA.The numerator on water and sanitation-related ODA in the government budget will be obtained from the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. The question on external funding collects data on the amount of donor funds that were included in government budget. Data for 2015 ODA disbursements through GLAAS will be available by end-2016. The scope of the question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 cycle to address all targets under SDG 6, including wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and water-related ecosystems.The denominator on total water and sanitation-related ODA disbursements will be obtained through OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) (purpose codes 14000-series for the water sector and purpose code 31140 for agricultural water resources). Data on ODA disbursements for 2015 will be made available through CRS in December 2016. Data on water and sanitation-related ODA included in the government budget will be available by end-2016 with the current cycle of UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) data. Until then, total water and sanitation-related ODA (denominator) will be reported. Total water and sanitation-related ODA will continue to be reported as an additional indicator going forward.In addition, the proportion of ODA channelled through the government treasury will be reported as an additional indicator. ODA channelled through treasury indicates a high level of cooperation and alignment between donors and national government in which the donors channel funds through the national budget process. The OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA for the water and sanitation among several categories including: sector policy and administration, water resources protection, large and basic water and sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management, agricultural water resources, and education and training. While these categories do not align directly with the target areas of SDG 6 individually, which limits the disaggregation of ODA among the SDG target areas, the combined ODA from these categories does align with a majority of the reported ODA to the water sector.As the numerator and denominator come from different sources, there is the possibility of different underlying assumptions regarding what should be included/excluded in the ODA figures. This could lead to situations in which the proportion of ODA included in government budget is greater than 1 (100%) if total ODA reported to OECD is lower than ODA reported to be included the budget. To guard against this possibility, the OECD will supply GLAAS with the reported ODA figures, broken down to the project level, so that respondents can match these with their on-budget project data. ODA represents only one aspect of international cooperation. To capture other dimensions, additional supporting indicators are available, including indicators for the Collaborative Behaviours identified by the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) partnership. Each behaviour has one or two key indicators for governments and for development partners. If the behaviours are jointly adapted by governments and development partners, long-term sector performance and sustainability would improve. For additional information on the Collaborative Behaviours see: http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/ The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for 'international cooperation and capacity development support' in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time. A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and sanitation related activities and programmes in the country outside the purview of the national government. A high value (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government and national policies and plans for water and sanitation. Data sources:The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on external funding has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to include wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has been collecting data on aid flows since 1973 through the OECD Creditor Reporting System based on a standard methodology and agreed definitions from member countries and other aid providers. The data are generally obtained on an activity level, and include numerous parameters to allow disaggregation by provider and recipient country, by type of finance, and by type of resources provided. Data are available for essentially all high-income countries as bilateral donors, and for an increasing number of middle-income aid providers, as well as multi-lateral lending institutions. Methodology on ODA data collection by OECD can be found here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htmThe data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).Collection process:National governments participating in the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country processes is collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.). Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts.Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual, validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.

'Clean' is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. Access to clean fuels and technologies Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO (i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits.For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as 'access to clean fuels and technologies' rather than 'access to non-solid fuels.' This shift will help ensure that health and other 'nexus' benefits are better counted, and thus realized.NANA The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 1300 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys.Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given country and year are obtained together using a single multivariate hierarchical model. Using household survey data as inputs, the model jointly estimates primary reliance on 6 specific fuel types: 1. unprocessed biomass (e.g. wood), 2. charcoal, 3. coal, 4. kerosene, 5. gaseous fuels (e.g. LPG), and 6. electricity; and a final category including other clean fuels (e.g. alcohol). Estimates of the proportion of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology (SDG indicator 7.1.2) are then derived by aggregating the estimates for primary reliance on clean fuel types from the model. Details on the model are published in Stoner et al. (2019).Only survey data providing individual fuel breakdowns and with less than 15% of the population reporting 'missing' and 'no cooking' and 'other fuels' were included in the analysis. Countries with no household fuel data but classified as high-income according to the World Bank country classification (37 countries) were assumed to have fully transitioned to clean household energy and therefore are reported as >95% access to clean technologies.No estimates were reported for low- and middle-income countries without data (Bulgaria, Cuba, Lebanon, Libya). Modelled specific fuel estimates were derived for 135 low- and middle-income countries and estimates of overall clean fuel use were reported for 190 countries. The indicator uses the type of primary fuels and technologies used for cooking, heating, and lighting as a practical surrogate for estimating human exposure to household (indoor) air pollution and its related disease burden, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. However epidemiological studies provide a science-based evidence for establishing those estimates using these surrogates.The indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel and stove for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating with polluting fuels can also be a contributor to household (indoor) air pollution levels. In addition, lighting with kerosene, a very polluting and hazardous fuel is also often used, and in some countries is the main fuel used for cooking.While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking household energy access for cooking fuel, it also presents a number of limitations that will need to be addressed over time. Currently there is a limited amount of available data capturing the type of fuel and devices used in the home for heating and lighting. Accordingly WHO in cooperation with World Bank, and the Global Alliance for Clean Cook stoves, is leading a survey enhancement process with representatives from country statistical offices and national household surveying agencies (e.g. Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Living Standards Measurement Survey) to better gather efficiently and harmoniously information on the fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. This process is currently in the piloting phase with expected rollout of the final household surveys questions (~6 questions in total) expected in the coming year. These few questions will replace and slightly expand the current set of questions commonly used on national multipurpose surveys to assess household energy.Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7 and harnesses the normative guidance in the WHO guidelines to benchmark tiers of energy access. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous international agencies working in the field. A first Global Energy Access Survey using this methodology has already been launched and is underway expecting to yield results by early 2017. Cooking, lighting and heating represent a large share of household energy use across the low- and middle-income countries. For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General's Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Data sources:Primary household fuels and technologies, particularly for cooking, is routinely collected at the national levels in most countries using censuses and surveys. Household surveys used include: United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS); WHO-supported World Health Surveys (WHS); and other reliable and nationally representative country surveys.The World Health Organization is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a database of statistics on access to clean and polluting fuels and technologies harvested from the full global body of household surveys for cooking, heating and lighting. Currently, the WHO Database covers cooking energy for 170 countries and one territory for the period 1960-2018 and is updated regularly and publicly available. For lighting, the WHO database includes data for 77 countries for the period 1963-2018. For heating, the WHO database includes data for 55 countries for the period 1977 - 2018.Presently WHO is working with national surveying agencies, country statistical offices and other stakeholders (e.g. researchers) to enhance multipurpose household survey instruments to gather data on the fuels and technologies used for heating and lighting.

Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.            The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.            The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.            Plant genetic resources       The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an 'accession' is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).             Animal genetic resources       The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds (i.e.  being reported to exist only in one country) stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on 'sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed' can be found in the  Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf). Plant genetic resources Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA): Any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture. Accession An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally. Base collection A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period. Plant genetic resources      The plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or in vitro collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.            Animal genetic resources      For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections  allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). Plant genetic resources      Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the 'number of accessions' as an indicator of diversity in ex situ collections:            Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.            A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.            Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring ex situ conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.             Animal genetic resources      Information on cryoconserved material in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be updated on a regular base. Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.            The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments.             The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it.             Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for, or, vice versa, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of the base collection.Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international centres together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Data sources:        Plant genetic resources: Data are sourced from officially appointed National Focal Points (NFP) (see http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/) and regional and international agricultural research centres holding PGRFA ex situ collections.

"SDG_ER_H2O_STRESS","Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources (%) The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental flow requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity. Pressure on renewable freshwater resources This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country's renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms 'water resources' and 'water withdrawal' are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. Internal renewable water resources Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TFWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental flow requirements (EFR), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in km3/year (109 m3/year).Stress (%) = TFWW / (TRWR - EFR) * 100Following the experience of the initial five years of application of the indicator, and consistent with the approach taken during the MDG program, the threshold of 25% has been identified as the upper limit for a full and unconditional safety of water stress as assessed by the indicator 6.4.2.That means on one hand, that values below 25% can be considered safe in any instance (no stress); on the other, that values above 25% should be regarded as potentially and increasingly problematic, and should be qualified and/or reduced.Above 25% of water stress, four classes have been identified to signal different levels of stress severity:NO STRESS <25% LOW 25% - 50% MEDIUM 50% - 75% HIGH 75-100%CRITICAL >100%  Freshwater withdrawal as a percentage of renewable freshwater resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator. Although there is no universal consensus on such thresholds, a proposal is presented below.Trends in freshwater withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other. Estimation of water withdrawal by sector may represent a limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water withdrawal data on a regular basis by sector. There is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country's borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress. Other limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include: - difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; - potentially large variation of sub-national data; - lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources;- lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; - lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and- the indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal non-renewable freshwater (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when freshwater withdrawal includes part or all of the water set aside for environmental flow requirements. Some of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the indicator at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count. The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in regard to 'withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity', i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.However, extremely low values may indicate the inability of a country to use properly its water resources for the benefit of the population. In such cases, a moderate and controlled increase in the value of the indicator can be a sign of positive development.

Stakeholder participation Stakeholder participation is essential to ensure the sustainability of water and sanitation management options over time, e.g. the choice of appropriate solutions for a given social and economic context, and the full understanding of the impacts of a certain development decision. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability. Local administrative units Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. Policies and procedures for participation of local communities Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are 'clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs'. For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. Data on local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for local participation is being collected through the current cycle of GLAAS, and will be available by end-2016. Until then, the presence of policies and procedures as reported at the national level for different subsectors will be reported.Additional data, including data measuring local participation from the OECD Water Governance Indicators and administrative data, will be progressively included in the calculation of the indicator as they become available. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services. Data sources:The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on community and user participation has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to address all targets in SDG 6, including water quality, water rights/allocation, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). A key component of IWRM is community participation and management of water resources at the local level. The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).The OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI), a technical platform gathering 100+ members from the public, private and non-for-profit sectors, is currently developing a set of Water Governance Indicators, within the implementation strategy of the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD 2015a). The Water Governance Indicators are expected to be able to provide additional information on local participation on the basis of an indicators system proposed in OECD (2015b) for measuring 'stakeholder engagement for inclusive water governance'. An indicator providing metrics on local participation will be developed and tested by 2017. Data will be made available through interactive platforms and databases in a format to foster policy dialogue and peer learning by 2018. A dedicated publication on 'Water Governance at a Glance' will be launched at the 8th World Water Forum in Brasilia (2018).Collection process:National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country processes are collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.) Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts.Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual, validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.

The formula to obtain these indicators are:            The number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults[it] = Number of commercial bank branches[it] / (Adult population[it] / 100,000)            The number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults[it] = Number of automated teller machines (ATMs)[it] / (Adult population[it] / 100,000)            Where 'i' indicates the country and 't' indicates the year. The source of information for the number of commercial bank branches and the number of ATMs is the FAS, while the source of information for the adult population is the World Development Indicators. Since 2009, the Financial Access Survey (FAS) collects information from administrative sources on an annual basis. The Central Bank or the main financial regulator reports yearly information including the two indicators that are part of the SDGs. Since its launch, 189 economies have contributed to the FAS, which now contains more than 100 series on financial inclusion covering the period 2004-2018. Access to and use of formal financial services is essential. Services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances allow people to manage their lives, plan and pay expenses, grow their businesses and improve their overall welfare. As banks remain one of the key institutions for access to formal financial services, having an accessible bank branch is an important initial point of access to financial services and therefore use of them. Bank branches are complemented by other important points of access such as automated teller machines of all formal financial institutions, which can extend financial services to remote locations. Data sources:The indicators in the FAS database are collected on an annual basis since 2009, covering the period 2004-2018. Information is collected from Central Banks or other main financial regulators for 189 countries. All data and metadata are available free of charge to the public on the IMF's FAS website, along with other key documents.Collection process:Every year, the FAS Team reaches out to FAS respondents to initiate the annual survey process. Data are compiled by countries and sent to the IMF through the ICS which allows for a secure submission of country information. Data are processed and validated by the FAS Team. Each submission is carefully reviewed, and when necessary, the FAS Team engages with the country authorities for clarifications or adjustments to the data provided. In case a country needs to add additional relevant information pertinent to the data reported, they can do so through the metadata portal in ICS.Every year, submissions are disseminated on the FAS website (data.imf.org/fas) on a rolling basis as soon as they are reviewed and validated by the FAS Team.

Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included. The age range will vary by country depending on the official age for entry to primary education. Organized learning programme An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of achieving pre-determined learning outcomes or the accomplishment of a specific set of educational tasks. Early childhood and primary education programmes are examples of organized learning programmes. Early childhood and primary education Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children's early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation. Official primary entry age The official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in the country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this indicator at the global level. The number of children in the relevant age group who participate in an organized learning programme is expressed as a percentage of the total population in the same age range. The indicator can be calculated both from administrative data and from household surveys. If the former, the number of enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools and the population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age is derived from population estimates. For the calculation of this indicator at the global level, population estimates from the UN Population Division are used. If derived from household surveys, both enrolments and population are collected at the same time.PROL0t1,AG(a-1) = E0t1,AG(a-1)SAPAG(a-1)where:PROL0t1,AG(a-1) = participation rate in organized learning one year before the official entry age a to primary educationE0t1,AG(a-1) = enrolment in early childhood or primary education (ISCED levels 0 and 1) aged one year below the official entry age a to primary educationSAPAG(a-1) = school-age population aged one year below the official entry age a to primary education Participation in learning programmes in the early years is not full time for many children, meaning that exposure to learning environments outside of the home will vary in intensity. The indicator measures the percentage of children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity of the programme, which limits the ability to draw conclusions on the extent to which this target is being achieved. More work is needed to ensure that the definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally with complementary information collected on the amount of time children spend in learning programmes. The indicator measures children's exposure to organized learning activities in the year prior to the start of primary school. A high value of the indicator shows a high degree of participation in organized learning immediately before the official entrance age to primary education. Data sources:Administrative data from schools and other centres of organized learning or from household surveys on enrolment by single year of age in early learning programmes; population censuses and surveys for population estimates by single year of age (if using administrative data on enrolment); administrative data from ministries of education on the official entrance age to primary education.Collection process:The UNESCO Institute for Statistics produces time series based on enrolment data reported by Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices and population estimates produced by the UN Population Division. The enrolment data are gathered through the annual Survey of Formal Education. Countries are asked to report data according to the levels of education defined in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability of resulting indicators.The data received are validated using electronic error detection systems that check for arithmetic errors and inconsistencies and trend analysis for implausible results. Queries are taken up with the country representatives reporting the data so that corrections can be made (of errors) or explanations given (of implausible but correct results). During this process countries are also encouraged to provide estimates for missing or incomplete data items.In addition, countries also have an opportunity to see and comment on the main indicators the UIS produces in an annual 'country review' of indicators.

Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods. Probability of dying The likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate. Life table A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to a set of age-specific mortality rates. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:            1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population Prospects 2012 revision.             2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions.             3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between 30 and 70.             4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.            The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries:      For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.            For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.            The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98       Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of death, can be found on page 6 of this document:            NCD Global Monitoring Framework: Indicator Definitions and Specifications. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2014 (http://www.who.int/nmh/ncd-tools/indicators/GMF_Indicator_Definitions_FinalNOV2014.pdf?ua=1) Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death. Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population. Data sources: The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Other possible data sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, and sample or sentinel registration systems.      Collection process: WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its cause-of-death estimates.

Under-five mortality rate The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.NANA The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from national data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for all countries. See references for details.             For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:            Civil registration: The under-five mortality rate can be derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and mid-year population counts from civil registration data to calculate death rates, which are then converted into age-specific probabilities of dying.            Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on a summary birth history, a series of questions asked of each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under-five and infant mortality rates. Censuses often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.            Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth history module.  Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. Data sources:            Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases, household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.            Civil registration      Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of the under-five and infant mortality rates from civil registration data is derived from a standard period abridged life table. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.            Population census and household survey data      The majority of survey data comes in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of their children ever born and the number that have died (or equivalently the number still alive).            Collection process:            For under-five mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO.             Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of under-five mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UNIGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the under-five mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data, UN IGME adjusts the estimates for crisis mortality.            Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data.            To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal: CME (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates.

'Improved' drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tubewells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater. Improved drinking water sources Improved drinking water sources include the following: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tubewells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater. Water source located on premises A water source is considered to be located on premises if the point of collection is within the dwelling, yard, or plot. Available when needed Households are able to access sufficient quantities of water when needed. Household surveys and censuses currently provide information on types of basic drinking water sources listed above, and also indicate if sources are on premises. These data sources often have information on the availability of water and increasingly on the quality of water at the household level, through direct testing of drinking water for faecal or chemical contamination. These data will be combined with data on availability and compliance with drinking water quality standards (faecal and chemical) from administrative reporting or regulatory bodies. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) estimates access to basic services for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression line to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of 'improved water' sources for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available.The JMP 2017 update and SDG baselines report describes in more detail how data on availability and quality from different sources, can be combined with data on use of different types of supplies, as recorded in the current JMP database to compute the safely managed drinking water services indicator. https://washdata.org/report/jmp-2017-report-final. Data on availability and safety of drinking water is increasingly available through a combination of household surveys and administrative sources including regulators, but definitions have yet to be standardized. Data on faecal and chemical contamination, drawn from household surveys and regulatory databases, will not cover all countries immediately. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed drinking water services for four out of eight SDG regions in 2017. MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to 'safe drinking water'. At the start of the MDG period, there was a complete lack of nationally representative data about drinking water safety in developing countries, and such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP developed the concept of 'improved' water sources, which was used as a proxy for 'safe water', as such sources are likely to be protected against faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track progress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, availability and quality.The above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of access and address safe management of drinking water services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality. The proposed indicator of 'safely managed drinking water services' is designed to address this. Data sources:Access to water and sanitation are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, and key determinants of child survival, maternal, and children's health, family wellbeing, and economic productivity. Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to drinking water and sanitation is therefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,700 censuses and surveys. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not always collect information on basic access, data are drawn from administrative records. Data on availability and quality of drinking water, and regulation by appropriate authorities will be collected by the JMP through consultation with the government departments responsible for drinking water supply and regulation. The JMP routinely conducts country consultations with national authorities before publishing country estimates. Data on availability and quality of water supplies are currently available from household surveys or administrative sources including regulators for over 70 high-income countries, and at least 30-40 low- and middle-income countries. Thus, data are currently available from ca. 100 countries, covering the majority of the global population. This number will rise as regulation becomes more widespread in low- and middle-income countries.The population data used by the JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those routinely updated by the UN Population Division.Collection process:WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing, all JMP estimates undergo rigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations give rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services and the monitoring systems that collect these data. JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any.

"SDG_SH_HAP_ASMORT","Age-standardized mortality rate attributed to household air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Age-standardized mortality rate attributed to household air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population) The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years).Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age);- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years). Mortality resulting from exposure to air pollution The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes.NANA Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the model are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013). The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer were calculated using the following formula :PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative risk.The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a). An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors. As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene.Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries.

"SDG_SH_PRV_SMOK","Age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older, by sex (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older, by sex (%) The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis. Tobacco use Tobacco use means use of smoked and/or smokeless tobacco products. 'Current use' means use within the previous 30 days at the time of the survey, whether daily or non-daily use. Tobacco products Tobacco products means products entirely or partly made of the leaf tobacco as raw material intended for human consumption through smoking, sucking, chewing or sniffing. Smoked tobacco products Smoked tobacco products include cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, cheroots, bidis, pipes, shisha (water pipes), roll-your-own tobacco, kretek and any other form of tobacco that is consumed by smoking. A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966-976 (2015).  Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is 'borrowed' from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year.  In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population.      Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution. Raw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used to calculate comparable estimates for this indicator.  Information from subnational surveys are not used.             In some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries where other forms of tobacco are also being consumed, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree.              The comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the estimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age ranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different tobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country's perception of which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored simultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of e-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries' definitions of tobacco use. The definition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, surveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use.             There is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use.  WHO's Tobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve comparability of indicators across countries. Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of SDG Target 3.a 'Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate'. Data sources: Prevalence rates by age-by-sex from national representative population surveys conducted since 1990:      - officially recognized by the national health authority;      - of randomly selected participants representative of the general population; and      - reporting at least one indicator measuring current tobacco use, daily tobacco use, current tobacco smoking, daily tobacco smoking, current cigarette smoking or daily cigarette smoking.            Official survey reports are gathered from Member States by one or more of the following methods:      - reporting system of the WHO FCTC;      - review of surveys conducted under the aegis of the Global Tobacco Surveillance System;      - review of other surveys conducted in collaboration with WHO such as STEPwise surveys and World Health Surveys;      - scanning of international surveillance databases such as those of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS); and      - identification and review of country-specific surveys that are not part of international surveillance systems.            Collection process: Reports either downloaded from websites or emailed by national counterparts. WHO shares and makes public the methodologies for its estimates through the WHO global report on trends in tobacco use 2000-2025 and the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic.

Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years).Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age);- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years). Mortality resulting from exposure to air pollution The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes.NANA Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]).

The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer were calculated using the following formula :PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative risk.The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a). An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern.

Numerator: Number of deaths due to road traffic crashes. Absolute figure indicating the number of people who die as a result of a road traffic crash.Denominator: Population (number of people by country)The model is based on the quality of data we received. As a health organization, WHO rely primarily on the submission of vital registration data from countries' Ministries of Health to WHO (through the official channels). These data, on all causes of death, are then analysed by our colleagues in the Health Information Systems department to decide on how good the data are, that is, determining if there is good completeness and coverage of deaths for all causes. We classified the countries on 4 categories or groups namely,Group1: Countries with death registration data (good vital/ death registration data)Group2: Countries with other sources of information on causes of deathGroup3: Countries with population less than 150000Group4: Countries without eligible death registration data.The Health Information Systems department analyses the quality and the completeness of the data. For the road safety model, if the country is considered by WHO to have good vital registration (VR) data this means that the country is in group1, then we don't apply a regression model to come up with an estimate (we may, however, project forward if the vital registration data are dated). If the country is considered in group 4 then we apply a negative binomial regression where N is the total road traffic deaths , C is constant term, Xi are a set of explanatory covariates, Pop is the population for the country-year, and ? is the negative binomial error term.For the countries from group 2, the regression method described above was used to project forward the most recent year for which an estimate of total deaths were available.Finally, the countries from group 3 which have a population less than 150,000 and did not have eligible death registration data, regression estimates were not used. Only the reported death were directly without adjustment.More details about this estimation process in Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015.

National Data Coordinators (NDCs), who were nominated by their governments, were trained in the project methodology. As representatives of their ministries, they were required to identify up to eight other road safety experts within their country from different sectors (e.g. health, police, transport, nongovernmental organizations and/or academia) and to facilitate a consensus meeting of these respondents. While each expert responded to the questionnaire based on their expertise, the consensus meeting facilitated by NDCs allowed for discussion of all responses, and the group used this discussion to agree on one final set of information that best represented their country's situation at the time (up to 2014, using the most recent data available). This was then submitted to the World Health Organization (WHO). More details are in the Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015.

The national average growth rate in the welfare aggregate is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the total population in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. Shared prosperity Promoting shared prosperity is defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in every country and is measured by calculating the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent. The choice of the bottom 40 percent as the target population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40 percent differs across countries depending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting shared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally.NANA Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not conduct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the 2015 update: the final year of the growth period (T1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than 2010, and the initial year (T0) is as close to T1 : 5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 : 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year.Once two surveys are selected for a country, the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in years T0 and T1 and then computing the annual average growth rate between those years using a compound growth formula, (Mean in T_1/Mean in T_0 )^(1/( T_1- T_0 ))-1. Growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the total population is computed in the same way using data for the total population. There are mainly two limitations of shared prosperity indicators: data availability and data quality. Data availability:Lack of household survey data is even more problematic for monitoring shared prosperity than for monitoring poverty. To monitor shared prosperity, two surveys of a country have to be conducted within five years or so during a chosen period, namely circa 2007-12. They have to be reasonably comparable to each other in terms of both the survey design and the construction of the welfare aggregates. Thus, not every survey that can generate poverty estimates can generate shared prosperity estimates. The second consideration is the coverage of countries, with data that are as recent as possible. Since shared prosperity must be estimated and used at the country level, there are good reasons for obtaining a wide coverage of countries, regardless of the size of their population. Moreover, for policy purposes it is important to have indicators for the most recent period possible for each country. The selection of survey years and countries needs to be made consistently and transparently, achieving a balance between matching the time period as closely as possible across all countries, including the most recent data, and ensuring the widest possible coverage of countries, across regions and income levels. In practice, this means that time periods will not match perfectly across countries. This is a compromise: while it introduces a degree of incomparability, it also creates a database that includes a larger set of countries than would be otherwise possible Data quality:Like for poverty rates, estimates of annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption are based on income or consumption data collected in household surveys. The same quality issues applying to poverty rates apply here. Specifically, measuring household living standards has its own complications. Surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. Moreover, income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption for about two-thirds of countries.Similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing, sampling frames, or the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose problems because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure, but in practice are often not. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary.The statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income data. Analysis of some 20 countries for which both consumption and income data were available from the same surveys found income to yield a higher mean than consumption but also higher inequality. When poverty measures based on consumption and income were compared, the two effects roughly cancelled each other out: there was no significant statistical difference. Invariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home during the interview visit. This is referred to as 'unit nonresponse' and is distinct from 'item nonresponse,' which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to income or consumption. To the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes may not be equally likely to respond. Richer households may be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their time or because of privacy concerns. It is conceivable that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are homeless or nomadic and hard to reach in standard household survey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less likely to be interviewed. This can bias both poverty and inequality measurement if not corrected for. Improvements in shared prosperity require both a growing economy and a consideration of equity. Shared prosperity explicitly recognizes that while growth is necessary for improving economic welfare in a society, progress is measured by how those gains are shared with its poorest members. Moreover, in an inclusive society it is not sufficient to raise everyone above an absolute minimum standard of living; it must ensure that economic growth increases prosperity among the poor over time.The decision to measure shared prosperity based on income or consumption was not taken to ignore the many other dimensions of welfare. It is motivated by the need for an indicator that is easy to understand, communicate, and measureâ<U+0080><U+0094>though measurement challenges exist. Indeed, shared prosperity comprises many dimensions of well-being of the less well-off, and when analyzing shared prosperity in the context of a country, it is important to consider a wide range of indicators of welfare. Data sources:The Global Database of Shared Prosperity was prepared by the Global Poverty Working Group, which comprises poverty measurement specialists of different departments of the World Bank Group. The database's primary source of data is the World Bank Group's PovcalNet database, an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate the World Bank Group's official poverty estimates measured at international poverty lines ($1.90 or $3.20 per day per capita). The datasets included in PovcalNet are provided and reviewed by the members of the Global Poverty Working Group. The choice of consumption or income to measure shared prosperity for a country is consistent with the welfare aggregate used to estimate extreme poverty rates in PovcalNet, unless there are strong arguments for using a different welfare aggregate. The practice adopted by the World Bank Group for estimating global and regional poverty rates is, in principle, to use per capita consumption expenditure as the welfare measure wherever available and to use income as the welfare measure for countries for which consumption data are unavailable. However, in some cases data on consumption may be available but are outdated or not shared with the World Bank Group for recent survey years. In these cases, if data on income are available, income is used for estimating shared prosperity.Collection process:To generate measures of shared prosperity that are reasonably comparable across countries, the World Bank Group has a standardized approach for choosing time periods, data sources, and other relevant parameters. The Global Database of Shared Prosperity is the result of these efforts. Its purpose is to allow for cross-country comparison and benchmarking, but users should consider alternative choices for surveys and time periods when cross-country comparison is not the primary consideration.

Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL) National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by individual countries, that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free to introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other purposes. The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter. Tariffs Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs.NA The indicator is calculated as the average share of national tariff lines that are free of duty. The following caveats should be taken in consideration while reviewing this indicator:Accurate estimates on special and differential treatment for developing countries do not exist, thus the calculations are limited to tariffs only. These are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when looking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential treatment that set criteria for eligibility.A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries' exporters for different reasons such as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin). As there is no accurate statistical information on the extent of the actual utilisation of each of these preferences, it is assumed that they are fully utilised.Duty free treatment is an indicator of market access, but is not always synonymous with preferential treatment for beneficiary countries, because a number of MFN tariffs are already at, or close to, zero, especially for fuels and minerals. International agreements on IT products also offer duty-free treatment for components and equipment used for production purpose. The calculation of this indicator will allow observing on how many products Developing countries and LDCs will have free access to Developed countries markets. When compared to the tariff rates applied to other countries, this indicator will allow assessing to which extent special and differential treatment has been accorded in terms of import tariffs. The evolution of this indicator will indicate progress on the phasing out of tariff rates on goods coming from Developing and LDCs. Data sources: The main information used to calculate indicators 10.a.1 is import tariff data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting directly National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, regional organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in charge of customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue authorities) or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the calculation of this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - http://www.macmap.org/ - WTO (IDB) - http://tao.wto.org - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases. Import tariff data included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are collected by contacting directly focal points in line national agencies or regional organizations (in the case of custom unions or regional economic communities). When available, data are downloaded from national or regional official websites. In some cases, data are purchased from private companies.

Total energy supply Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.NANA This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources - statistics used to produce a national energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described in the 'International Recommendations for Energy Statistics' (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at:  unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires/.Once a national energy balance is developed, the indicator can be obtained by dividing total energy supply over GDP. Energy intensity is only an imperfect proxy for energy efficiency. It can be affected by a number of factors, such as climate, structure of the economy, nature of economic activities etc. that are not necessarily linked to pure efficiency. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.  Data sources: Total energy supply is typically calculated in the making of national energy balances. Energy balances are compiled based on data collected for around 150 economies from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and for all countries in the world from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).

To make the indicator meaningful for cross-country comparison, the number of commercial banks branches is scaled per 100,00 adults. Number of automated teller machines (ATMs) The number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults, refers to the number of ATMs in the country for all types of financial institutions such as: commercial banks, non-deposit taking microfinance institutions, deposit taking micro finance institutions, credit union and financial cooperatives, among other. This information is reported every year by the Central Bank or the main financial regulator of the country. To make the indicator meaningful for cross-country comparison, the number of ATMs is scaled per 100,00 adults.NA The indicators are calculated based on data collected directly from the Central Bank or the main financial regulator in the country. The formula to obtain these indicators are:            The number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults[it] = Number of commercial bank branches[it] / (Adult population[it] / 100,000)            The number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults[it] = Number of automated teller machines (ATMs)[it] / (Adult population[it] / 100,000)            Where 'i' indicates the country and 't' indicates the year. The source of information for the number of commercial bank branches and the number of ATMs is the FAS, while the source of information for the adult population is the World Development Indicators. Since 2009, the Financial Access Survey (FAS) collects information from administrative sources on an annual basis. The Central Bank or the main financial regulator reports yearly information including the two indicators that are part of the SDGs. Since its launch, 189 economies have contributed to the FAS, which now contains more than 100 series on financial inclusion covering the period 2004-2018. Access to and use of formal financial services is essential. Services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances allow people to manage their lives, plan and pay expenses, grow their businesses and improve their overall welfare. As banks remain one of the key institutions for access to formal financial services, having an accessible bank branch is an important initial point of access to financial services and therefore use of them. Bank branches are complemented by other important points of access such as automated teller machines of all formal financial institutions, which can extend financial services to remote locations. Data sources:The indicators in the FAS database are collected on an annual basis since 2009, covering the period 2004-2018. Information is collected from Central Banks or other main financial regulators for 189 countries. All data and metadata are available free of charge to the public on the IMF's FAS website, along with other key documents.Collection process:Every year, the FAS Team reaches out to FAS respondents to initiate the annual survey process. Data are compiled by countries and sent to the IMF through the ICS which allows for a secure submission of country information. Data are processed and validated by the FAS Team. Each submission is carefully reviewed, and when necessary, the FAS Team engages with the country authorities for clarifications or adjustments to the data provided.

This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of members of parliament.INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the proportion of positions held by women in local government.It is expressed as a percentage of elected positions held by women in legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government. Seats (5.5.1a) Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election. Local government (5.5.1b) Local government is one of the sub-national spheres of government and a result of decentralization, a process of transferring political, fiscal, and administrative powers from the central government to sub-national units of government distributed across the territory of a country to regulate and/or run certain government functions or public services on their own. The definition of local government follows the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) distinction between central, state, and local government (para 4.129). Local government consists of local government units, defined in the SNA as 'institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes' (para 4.145). What constitutes local government of a given country is defined by that country's national legal framework, including national constitutions and local government acts or equivalent legislation.Each local government unit typically includes a legislative/ deliberative body and an executive body. Legislative/ deliberative bodies, such as councils or assemblies, are formal entities with a prescribed number of members as per national or state legislation. They are usually elected by universal suffrage and have decision-making power, including the ability to issue by-laws, on a range of local aspects of public affairs. Executive bodies, consisting of an executive committee or a mayor, may be elected, appointed or nominated and they prepare and execute decisions made by the legislative/ deliberative body. Elected positions are the most common manner of selection of local government members. They are selected in local elections, based on a system of choosing political office holders in which the voters cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The category of elected positions includes both elected persons who competed on openly contested seats and persons selected during the electoral processes on reserved seats or through a candidate quota.By comparison, members selected on appointed positions (the least common manner of selection of local government members) are nominated, typically by government officials from higher-ranking tiers of government. Appointed members of local government are more frequent among the leadership positions, such as the heads of the executive body, representatives of specific groups (e.g., women, disadvantaged groups, youth); and, temporary committees/delegations/caretakers appointed by government officials when a council has been dissolved.NA INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament.There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)The method of computation is as follows:Indicator 5.5.1(b) = (Number of seats held by women * 100) / Total number of seats held by women and men (unit: %) INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking.- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women's contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) refers to the representation of women among elected positions of legislative/deliberative bodies of local government. This is a strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, and mirrors the SDG indicator measuring women's representation at national level, in parliament. This is also a limitation in that the indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local government officials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously holding a position within the legislative/deliberative body, or who are appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator. It is recommended that women's representation in executive positions, particularly at the level of the head of the executive (such as mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels, but not as a headline SDG indicator.Importantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of local government and not the quality of their participation. Countries may therefore consider assessing political participation through national or subnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research. Additional indicators of political participation may also be monitored at national level, such as women's share among voters and candidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps on women's political participation.  Finally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of local government, such as public administration staff, are not included in the indicator 5.5.1(b), and may be covered by other indicators in the SDG framework, particularly within the Goal 16 on inclusive societies. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision making. Women's participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women's opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women's empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies.Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women's participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women's access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase women's shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)        Women's and men's right to exercise their political rights on an equal basis, and at all levels of decision-making, is recognized in the SDGs and enshrined in many human and political rights declarations, conventions and resolutions agreed to by most countries in the world. Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the degree to which gender balance has been achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in local government. Indicator 5.5.1(b) complements the Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in national parliaments, and accounts for the representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are covered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a): Data sources:The data used are official statistics received from parliaments. The data are provided by national parliaments and updated after an election or parliamentary renewal. National parliaments also transmit their data to the IPU at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat. After each general election or renewal a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliament. INDICATOR 5.5.1(b): Data sources:Administrative data based on electoral records are the main source of data on elected members of local government, and the recommended data source for Indicator 5.5.1(b). Electoral records are produced and upheld by Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) or equivalent bodies tasked with organizing elections at local level. EMBs are part of the National Statistical System, and often specifically mentioned in the national statistics acts as producers of official statistics. The use of electoral records to measure women's representation in local government and monitoring of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is cost-effective, straightforward and timely. No adjustments or estimates are necessary to transform the administrative information into statistics for monitoring the indicator. The conceptual framework at the basis of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is consistent with the conceptual framework at the basis of local elections, as both are provided by national legal framework. The data used to calculate Indicator 5.5.1(b) refer to information on election winners, disaggregated by sex, and the coverage of the reference population (in this case, the elected officials) should be complete. In countries where the electoral records are electronic and centralized, information on numbers of women and men in elected positions can be made available as soon as the official results of elections are released. Two other types of sources of data may be used in the few instances where electoral records are not electronic or not centralized. One additional type of source is also administrative, and refers to public administration data available to line ministries overseeing local government. However, its use for statistics may be less straightforward compared to centralized electoral records. The scope of public administration records is beyond the elected positions, and information on women and men in elected positions of local government may be mixed with information on public administration employees, which are not covered by this indicator. Therefore, additional data processing and resources may be required to carefully extract the information needed. In some cases, the forms used as the basis for administrative records may need to be modified to ensure recording of the positions as being elected, in legislative/deliberative bodies, as well as the sex of persons in those positions. In other cases, some elected positions may not be covered in the records maintained, for example, if the administrative records are restricted to only those positions that are on the government payroll. Another type of data source that may provide information on women and men in local government in the absence of centralized electronic election records, refers to existing surveys or censuses using local government units as units of observation. These surveys or censuses may be undertaken by National Statistical Offices and/or line ministries and may take the form of (a) local government censuses or surveys; (b) establishment survey; and (c) municipality surveys. These surveys/census may already include, in the data collection tool dedicated to their main purpose, a few questions on the number of members of local legislative/deliberative and executive bodies by sex and other individual characteristics such as age and education; or may require the integration of such questions. Similar to other censuses and surveys, a low response rate can result in bias of the statistics obtained. Sampling errors may also add to the bias, in ways that cannot be assessed in the absence of a good understanding of distribution of women's and men's representation across different local government units across the territory of a country.Collection process:The compilation of data, coordinated by UN Women and undertaken with the support of UN Regional Commissions, uses two mechanisms:-	data request forms sent to EMBs and NSOs directly or through UN Regional Commissions -	on-line dissemination of data by NSS entities who are the primary source of data or in charge with coordination of SDGs, including EMBs and/or NSOs. This process will be done in a transparent manner, based on communication with NSS focal points, so that the NSS has a chance to validate or dismiss a country's compiled data.

By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking.- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women's contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) refers to the representation of women among elected positions of legislative/deliberative bodies of local government. This is a strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, and mirrors the SDG indicator measuring women's representation at national level, in parliament. This is also a limitation in that the indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local government officials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously holding a position within the legislative/deliberative body, or who are appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator. It is recommended that women's representation in executive positions, particularly at the level of the head of the executive (such as mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels, but not as a headline SDG indicator.Importantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of local government and not the quality of their participation. Countries may therefore consider assessing political participation through national or subnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research. Additional indicators of political participation may also be monitored at national level, such as women's share among voters and candidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps on women's political participation.  Finally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of local government, such as public administration staff, are not included in the indicator 5.5.1(b), and may be covered by other indicators in the SDG framework, particularly within the Goal 16 on inclusive societies. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision making. Women's participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women's opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women's empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies.Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women's participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women's access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase women's shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)        Women's and men's right to exercise their political rights on an equal basis, and at all levels of decision-making, is recognized in the SDGs and enshrined in many human and political rights declarations, conventions and resolutions agreed to by most countries in the world. Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the degree to which gender balance has been achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in local government. Indicator 5.5.1(b) complements the Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in national parliaments, and accounts for the representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are covered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a): Data sources:The data used are official statistics received from parliaments. The data are provided by national parliaments and updated after an election or parliamentary renewal. National parliaments also transmit their data to the IPU at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat. After each general election or renewal a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliament. INDICATOR 5.5.1(b): Data sources:Administrative data based on electoral records are the main source of data on elected members of local government, and the recommended data source for Indicator 5.5.1(b). Electoral records are produced and upheld by Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) or equivalent bodies tasked with organizing elections at local level. EMBs are part of the National Statistical System, and often specifically mentioned in the national statistics acts as producers of official statistics. The use of electoral records to measure women's representation in local government and monitoring of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is cost-effective, straightforward and timely. No adjustments or estimates are necessary to transform the administrative information into statistics for monitoring the indicator. The conceptual framework at the basis of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is consistent with the conceptual framework at the basis of local elections, as both are provided by national legal framework. The data used to calculate Indicator 5.5.1(b) refer to information on election winners, disaggregated by sex, and the coverage of the reference population (in this case, the elected officials) should be complete. In countries where the electoral records are electronic and centralized, information on numbers of women and men in elected positions can be made available as soon as the official results of elections are released. Two other types of sources of data may be used in the few instances where electoral records are not electronic or not centralized. One additional type of source is also administrative, and refers to public administration data available to line ministries overseeing local government. However, its use for statistics may be less straightforward compared to centralized electoral records. The scope of public administration records is beyond the elected positions, and information on women and men in elected positions of local government may be mixed with information on public administration employees, which are not covered by this indicator. Therefore, additional data processing and resources may be required to carefully extract the information needed. In some cases, the forms used as the basis for administrative records may need to be modified to ensure recording of the positions as being elected, in legislative/deliberative bodies, as well as the sex of persons in those positions. In other cases, some elected positions may not be covered in the records maintained, for example, if the administrative records are restricted to only those positions that are on the government payroll. Another type of data source that may provide information on women and men in local government in the absence of centralized electronic election records, refers to existing surveys or censuses using local government units as units of observation. These surveys or censuses may be undertaken by National Statistical Offices and/or line ministries and may take the form of (a) local government censuses or surveys; (b) establishment survey; and (c) municipality surveys. These surveys/census may already include, in the data collection tool dedicated to their main purpose, a few questions on the number of members of local legislative/deliberative and executive bodies by sex and other individual characteristics such as age and education; or may require the integration of such questions. Similar to other censuses and surveys, a low response rate can result in bias of the statistics obtained. Sampling errors may also add to the bias, in ways that cannot be assessed in the absence of a good understanding of distribution of women's and men's representation across different local government units across the territory of a country.Collection process:The compilation of data, coordinated by UN Women and undertaken with the support of UN Regional Commissions, uses two mechanisms:-	data request forms sent to EMBs and NSOs directly or through UN Regional Commissions -	on-line dissemination of data by NSS entities who are the primary source of data or in charge with coordination of SDGs, including EMBs and/or NSOs. This process will be done in a transparent manner, based on communication with NSS focal points, so that the NSS has a chance to validate or dismiss a country's compiled data.

"SDG_SH_AAP_MORT","Crude death rate attributed to ambient air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Crude death rate attributed to ambient air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population) The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years).Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age);- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years). Mortality resulting from exposure to air pollution The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes.NANA Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the model are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013). The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer were calculated using the following formula :PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative risk.The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a). An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors. As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene.Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries.

"SDG_SH_ALC_CONSPT","Alcohol consumption per capita (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year (litres of pure alcohol)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Alcohol consumption per capita (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year (litres of pure alcohol) Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcoholTotal alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum of recorded APC three-year average and unrecorded APC as a proportion of total) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption. Recorded alcohol consumption refers to official statistics at country level (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by IHME. Recorded alcohol per capita (APC) Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other) from different sources. The first priority in the decision tree is given to government national statistics; second are country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on interviews or fieldwork (GlobalData (formerly Canadean), International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR), Wine Institute; historically World Drink Trends) or data from the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV); third is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT), and fourth is data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review. For countries, where the data source is FAOSTAT the unrecorded consumption may be included in the recorded consumption. As from the introduction of the 'Other' beverage-specific category, beer includes malt beers, wine includes wine made from grapes, spirits include all distilled beverages, and other includes one or several other alcoholic beverages, such as fermented beverages made from sorghum, maize, millet, rice, or cider, fruit wine, fortified wine, etc. For unrecorded APC, the first priority in the decision tree is given to nationally representative empirical data; these are often general population surveys in countries where alcohol is legal. Second are specific other empirical investigations, and third is expert opinion supported by periodic survey of experts at country level (50 countries with significant estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption) using modified Delphi-technique.For recorded APC, in order to make the conversion into litres of pure alcohol, the alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is considered to be as follows: Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and Other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%; fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%). Survey questions on consumption of unrecorded alcohol are converted into estimates per year of unrecorded APC. In some countries, unrecorded is estimated based on confiscated alcohol confiscated by customs or police. Alcohol consumed by tourists The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age and older) in a country were based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounted for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years and older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assumed the following: (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or positive).NA Numerator: The sum of the amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years), average during three calendar years, in litres of pure alcohol, and the amount of unrecorded alcohol per capita consumption (15+ years), during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption.Denominator: Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium variant. The indicator is feasible and suitable for monitoring purposes as evidenced by availability of data from 190 countries and inclusion of this indicator in global, regional and national monitoring frameworks. This is the key indicator for alcohol exposure in populations. The data available (based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation) do not enable the disaggregation of alcohol per capita consumption (APC) by sex or age; to this end, other data sources, such as survey data, are needed. The estimation of unrecorded APC remains a challenge, and triangulation of data from different sources as well as Delphi-techniques are used for increasing validity of estimates. In recent time the number of research activities focused on improvement of the estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption as well as their geographical coverage have increased substantially. As a result, it leads to a more accurate assessment of the total amount of alcohol consumed per person per year in a given country. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on the course of disorders and their outcomes in individuals. Alcohol consumption has been identified as a component cause for more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. Per capita alcohol consumption is widely accepted as the best possible indicator of alcohol exposure in populations and the key indicator for estimation of alcohol-attributable disease burden and alcohol-attributable deaths. Its correct interpretation requires the use of additional population-based indicators such as prevalence of drinking, and, as a result, stimulates development of national monitoring systems on alcohol and health involving contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including alcohol production and trade sectors. Data sources: Recorded: Government statistics or, alternatively, alcohol industry statistics in the public domain, FAOSTAT;Unrecorded: Nationally representative empirical data or, alternatively, specific empirical investigations, expert opinion.Collection process: The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health is conducted periodically (latest one in 2016) in collaboration with all six WHO regional offices.

"SDG_SH_DYN_IMRT","Infant mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Infant mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Under-five mortality rate The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.NANA The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from national data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for all countries. See references for details.             For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:            Civil registration: The under-five mortality rate can be derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and mid-year population counts from civil registration data to calculate death rates, which are then converted into age-specific probabilities of dying.            Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on a summary birth history, a series of questions asked of each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under-five and infant mortality rates. Censuses often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.            Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth history module.  Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. Data sources:            Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases, household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.            Civil registration      Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of the under-five and infant mortality rates from civil registration data is derived from a standard period abridged life table. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.            Population census and household survey data      The majority of survey data comes in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of their children ever born and the number that have died (or equivalently the number still alive).            Collection process:            For under-five mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO.             Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of under-five mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UNIGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the under-five mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data, UN IGME adjusts the estimates for crisis mortality.            Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data.            To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal: CME (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates.

Proportion = (Numerator/Denominator) * 100 Until recently, the indicator captured results for married and in-union women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are using any type of contraception. In the phase of the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS-7) and later rounds, the questionnaire are extended to respondents whether they are using contraception or not. One limitation of the data is that unmarried women and girls are not included.As of early 2020, a total of 57 countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, have at least one survey with data on all three questions necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. Broader data sources are needed and efforts to increase data coverage are underway. Current data on the indicator are mainly derived from the DHS and efforts are being made to include the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the Generation and Gender Survey (GGS) and other country-specific surveys.In many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude the homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups. Women's and girls' autonomy in decision making about sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive use and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights.  Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered empowered to exercise their reproductive rights.Regarding decision-making on use of contraception, a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made 'mainly by the partner', as opposed to decision being made 'by the woman alone' or 'by the woman jointly with the partner'. Depending in the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman 'alone' or 'jointly with the partner' does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. A woman's ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women's empowerment. Data sources:Current data on the indicator are mainly derived from nationally representative DHS.  Data sources increasingly include MICS and GGS, and other country-specific surveys. Collection process:Data is collected in line with the methodology used for the relevant national survey. Relevant country-specific surveysData for SDG indicator 5.6.1 may be collectecd through existing county-specific surveys. For existing national household surveys, it must be ascertained that the sampling design does not systematically exclude subgroups of the population that are important to SDG 5.6.1, specifically, women of reproductive age (15-49) that are currently married or in union. Surveys that cover only certain population subgroups, such as women who speak the dominant language or women from the main ethnic group, may exclude the experiences of a large number of women. Data on the ethnicity and religion of the survey participants should be collected whenever available. The survey should have a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households), be nationally-representative, and representative, at least, at one administrative level below the national level.Surveys on unrelated topics may not be good candidates for the incorporation of the SDG 5.6.1 questions. The sensitivity of the topics addressed in health surveys, in particular, those examining women's health, making them a feasible instrument for incorporating questions on women's experience of decision making in sex relations, use of contraceptive, and health care for themselves.In order to generate data for SDG 5.6.1, all three questions must be included in the survey. The three questiones in the Definition section provides generic questions that can be used in country-specific surveys.  For the first and the second questions, these should include distinct categories for women making decisions herself, and women making decisions jointly with her husband/partner.

'Improved' sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Population with a basic handwashing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household. Improved sanitation facilities Improved sanitation facilities include the following: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Safely disposed in situ When pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied, the excreta may still remain isolated from human contact and can be considered safely managed. For example, with the new SDG indicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a common practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services. Treated offsite Not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment site. For instance, a portion may leak from the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. Similarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to open ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once the excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment equipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of SDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will initially be assessed based on the reported level of treatment. Method of computation: Household surveys and censuses provide data on use of types of basic sanitation facilities listed above, as well as the presence of handwashing materials in the home. The percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services is calculated by combining data on the proportion of the population using different types of basic sanitation facilities with estimates of the proportion of faecal waste which is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. The JMP estimates use of basic sanitation facilities for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression model to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of 'improved sanitation' facilities for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available.The JMP 2017 update and SDG baselines report describes in more detail how estimates of the proportion of household wastewater that is safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site have been combined with data on use of different types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the JMP global database. A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. Data on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017.Presence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. Data were available for 70 countries in 2017. MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to 'basic sanitation'. The JMP developed the metric of use of 'improved' sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards.The above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or the transport and treatment of wastes at a designated treatment site. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment).Handwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In 2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that the most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household surveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the presence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether households have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by survey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing behaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour. Data sources:Access to water and sanitation are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, and key determinants of child survival, maternal, and children's health, family wellbeing, and economic productivity. Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to sanitation is therefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,700 surveys and censuses. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not always collect information on basic access, data are drawn from administrative records.Estimates of excreta management will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of basic sanitation facilities as needed. Administrative, population and environmental data can also be combined to estimate safe disposal or transport of excreta, when no country data are available. Data on disposal or treatment of excreta are limited but estimates for safe management of faecal wastes can be calculated based on faecal waste flows associated with the use of different types of basic sanitation facility.Since the handwashing with soap survey questions were standardized in 2009, over 70 DHS and MICS surveys have included the module. JMP published handwashing estimates for 12 countries in its 2014 update, for 54 countries in its 2015 update, and for 70 countries in its 2017 update.The population data used by JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those established by the UN Population Division.Collection process:WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing, all JMP estimates undergo rigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations give rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services and the monitoring systems that collect these data. The JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any.

Case of malaria Case of malaria is defined as the occurrence of malaria infection in a person whom the presence of malaria parasites in the blood has been confirmed by a diagnostic test. The population considered is the population at risk of the disease.NANA Malaria incidence (1) is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the UN Population Division and the total proportion at risk estimated by a country's National Malaria Control Programme. More specifically, the country estimates what is the proportion at high risk (H) and what is the proportion at low risk (L) and the total population at risk is estimated as UN Population x (H + L).            The total number of new cases, T, is estimated from the number of malaria cases reported by a Ministry of Health which is adjusted to take into account (i) incompleteness in reporting systems (ii) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, self-medicating or not seeking treatment at all, and (iii) potential over-diagnosis through the lack of laboratory confirmation of cases. The procedure, which is described in the World malaria report 2009 (2), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness and likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with data obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health-service use. Briefly,              T = (a + (c * e) / d) * (1 + (h/g) + ((1 - g - h) / 2) / g)              where:      a is malaria cases confirmed in public sector      b is suspected cases tested      c is presumed cases (not tested but treated as malaria)      d is reporting completeness      e is test positivity rate (malaria positive fraction) = a/b      f is cases in public sector, calculated by (a + (c x e))/d      g is treatment seeking fraction in public sector      h is treatment seeking fraction in private sector      i is the fraction not seeking treatment, calculated by (1-g-h)/2       j is cases in private sector, calculated by f x h/g      k is cases not in private and not in public, calculated by f x i/g      T is total cases, calculated by f + j + k.

"SDG_SL_DOM_TSPDCW","Proportion of time spent on unpaid care work, by sex, age and location (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of time spent on unpaid care work, by sex, age and location (%) This indicator is defined as the proportion of time spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'. Unpaid domestic and care work Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'. Productive activity An activity is said to be productive or to fall within the 'general production boundary' if it satisfies the third-person criterion (the activity can be delegated to another person and yield the same desired results).Productive activities can be further classified based on the ILO framework for work statistics (included in the 19th ICLS resolution) into:a)	Own-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)b)	Employment (activities to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit)c)	Unpaid trainee work (any unpaid activity to produce goods or provide services for others, in order to acquire workplace experience or skills in a trade or profession)d)	Volunteer work (any unpaid, non-compulsory activity to produce goods or provide services for others)e)	Other forms of workThe own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.Indicator 5.4.1 only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'.As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.NA Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day. Weekly data is averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated by dividing the daily average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work by 24 hours. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated as:Indicator 5.4.1 = ((daily number of hours spent on domestic work + daily number of hours spent on core work) / 24) * 100If data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain daily time spent.Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. SDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. Time use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: a)	Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity.  b)	Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. c)	Time-use data presented refer to the 'main activity' only. Any 'secondary activity' performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. d)	Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.  Data sources:Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level.Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection.Collection process:The official counterparts at the country level are the national statistical offices. Data are compiled and validated. If there are inconsistencies or issues with the data, UNSD consults the focal point in the national statistical office. The data for SDG 5.4.1 are, as much as possible, in line with relevant international standards, or properly footnoted.

"SDG_SL_EMP_FTLINJUR","Fatal occupational injuries among employees, by sex and migrant status (per 100,000 employees)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Fatal occupational injuries among employees, by sex and migrant status (per 100,000 employees) This indicator provides information on the number of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 workers in the reference group during the reference period. It is a measure of the personal likelihood or risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury for each worker in the reference group.The number of occupational injuries expressed per a given number of workers in the reference group is also known as the incidence rate of occupational injuries. Occupational accident An unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer. Occupational injury Any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. An occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-fatal injuries could entail the loss of work days). Fatal occupational injury An occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident. The incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be calculated separately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a different source than those on non-fatal injuries, which would make their sum into total occupational accidents inaccurate.The fatal occupational injury incidence rate is expressed per 100,000 workers in the reference group, and thus, is calculated as follows:  Fatal occupational injury incidence rate = (New cases of fatal injury during the reference year / Workers in the reference group during the reference year) * 100,000Similarly, the non-fatal occupational injury incidence rate is calculated as follows:  Non fatal occupational injury incidence rate = (New cases of non fatal injury during the reference year / Workers in the reference group during the reference year) * 100,000In calculating the average number of workers, the number of part-time workers should be converted to full-time equivalents. For the calculation of rates, the numerator and the denominator should have the same coverage. For example, if self-employed persons are not covered by the source of statistics on fatal occupational injuries, they should also be taken out of the denominator. There may be problems of under reporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality. Under reporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development, but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. Double-counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics.Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed. This indicator provides valuable information that could be used to formulate policies and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries, diseases and deaths. It could also be used to monitor the implementation of these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular occupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide information for prevention purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations and economic activities with the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety and reveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers' organizations, workers and workers' organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers, employers' organizations, workers and workers' organizations to introduce accident prevention measures. Data sources:The recommended data sources are different types of administrative records, such as records of national systems for the notification of occupational injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; insurance and compensation records, death registers), supplemented by household surveys (especially in order to cover informal sector enterprises and the self-employed) and/or establishment surveys.The metadata should clearly specify (i) whether the statistics relate to cases of occupational injury which have been reported (to an accident notification system or to an accident compensation scheme), compensated (by an accident insurance scheme) or identified in some other way (for example through a survey of households or establishments) and (ii) whether cases of occupational disease and cases of injury due to commuting accidents are excluded from the statistics, as recommended.Collection process:The ILO sends out its annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.

"SDG_SL_TLF_UEM","Unemployment rate, by sex and age (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Unemployment rate, by sex and age (%) The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed. Unemployed persons Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) 'not in employment' is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to 'seek employment' refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural  undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise's registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) 'currently available' serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups). Persons in employment Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as one week or one day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. Labour force The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment. Unemployment rate = (Total unemployment / Total labour force) * 100 Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate is useful as an indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key measure of labour underutilization, in many developing countries, the significance and meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization. The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search. Data sources:The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household surveys with an appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. It is important to note that unemployment data derived from employment office records or unemployment registers would not refer to unemployment (as defined for the purposes of this indicator, using the three-criteria of being without a job, seeking employment and available for employment) but to registered unemployment, and thus, it would not be comparable with indicator 8.5.2.Collection process:The ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire on labour statistics to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting for the latest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators. Indicator 8.5.2 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and national statistical offices or through the processing of microdata sets of national labour force surveys.

Informal unions are generally defined as those in which a couple lives together for some time, intends to have a lasting relationship, but for which there has been no formal civil or religious ceremony (i.e., cohabitation).NANA Number of women aged 20-24 who were first married or in union before age 15 (or before age 18) divided by the total number of women aged 20-24 in the population multiplied by 100 There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. The modules used to collect information on marital status among women and men of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized. Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl's development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights - such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices. Data sources:Household surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since around the late 1980s. In some countries, such data are also collected through national censuses or other national household surveys.Collection process:UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).	As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why.

Definition of violence against women and girls and of the forms of violence specified under this indicator are presented in the next section (Concepts).NOTE: Due to constraints related to feasibility (as noted in the Feasibility section below), this indicator currently globally reports only on the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 to 49 who have experienced physical and/or sexual partner violence. Violence against women According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), violence against women is 'Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [.]'. See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm Intimate partner violence against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union.The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: 1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling  hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. 2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on someone, whether by use of force, intimidation or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly defined as: being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.3. Psychological violence consists of any act intended to induce fear or emotional distress caused by a person's behaviour or act. It includes a range of behaviors that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission).  For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014) and the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes ICCS (UNODC, 2015).NANA This indicator calls for breakdown by form of violence and by age group. Countries are encouraged to compute prevalence data for each form of violence as detailed below to assist comparability at the regional and global levels:1. Physical violence: Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 2. Sexual violence: Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 3. Psychological violence: Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100 4. Any form of physical and/or sexual violence: Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 1005. Any form of physical, sexual and/or psychological violence:Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical, sexual and/or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100        NOTE: To assist comparability at the regional and global level, countries are encouraged to additionally compute the above figures for ever-partnered women aged 15 to 49. Regional and global reporting on this indicator currently only includes data computed by countries for #4 above (i.e., any form of physical and/or sexual partner violence, and for the 15-49 age group). For further details, see Feasibility section above. Comparability:The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and of the different forms of violence and different survey question formulations, used diverse age groups, or used different denominators, as well as the quality of interviewer training. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented, and the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.Regularity of data production:Since 2005, only about 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women. Obtaining data on violence against women is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available.Feasibility:This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate partner violence: physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global consensus on how physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence-which may be conceptualised differently across cultures and in different contexts-is still a Tear III sub-indicator. Since it is not yet feasible to report on psychological partner violence, this indicator currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting on psychological intimate partner violence. This will enable reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future.  Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence experienced by ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above. However, a majority of data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports violence experienced by ever-partnered women and girls 15-49 years of age. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to address this issue and to better understand and measure partner violence against women aged 50 and above. Intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence that women and girls face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, violence between intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships, particularly in the context of marriage or other unions. Violence against women and girls is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality.Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk; explore the barriers to seeking help; and ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies, and developing effective responses and programmes. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximise the effectiveness of interventions (especially in resource-constrained settings). Data sources:The SDG 5.2.1 Indicator Database comprises namely data from population-based household surveys implementing an internationally standardised methodology. A significant proportion of data are gathered through the inclusion of a Domestic Violence Module in the DHS. In addition, some data come from dedicated surveys on violence against women in countries that have implemented, for example, WHO's violence against women survey methodology. Where available, other dedicated surveys are included if the data are deemed comparable. All sources date from 2005 onwards.   Collection process:Data are collated by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Women Data from data published by National Statistics Offices or other relevant national entities. For efficiency, some data are collated using existing data compiling online platforms (e.g., DHS StatCompiler). For a few countries, data are recalculated for harmonization regarding age group (15 to 49) and type of intimate partner violence (any form of physical and/or sexual partner violence).

"SDG_AG_PRD_ORTIND","Agriculture orientation index for government expenditures","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Agriculture orientation index for government expenditures The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures is defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, divided by the Agriculture value added share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector. The measure is a currency-free index, calculated as the ratio of these two shares. National governments are requested to compile Government Expenditures according to the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), and Agriculture value added share of GDP according to the System of National Accounts (SNA). Agriculture Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector, or Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2). Government Expenditure Government Expenditure are all expense and acquisition of non-financial assets associated with supporting a particular sector, as defined in the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).               Governmhttps://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-01.pdfent Expenditure are classified according to the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), a classification developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD). Agriculture value-added Agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the System of National Accounts (SNA). AOI = Agriculture share of government expenditures / Agriculture value added share of GDP        Where:        Agriculture share of government expenditures = (Central government expenditure on agriculture / Total centrl government expenditure) x 100                Agriculture refers to COFOG category 042 (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting); and        (Agriculture value-added share of GDP = AGriculture value added / GDP) * 100                Agriculture refers to the Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting), equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2. Since the numerator of this data is based on administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government expenditure data. For the denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.      The key limitation with this indicator is that it takes into account only central government expenditure. To the extent that some countries may have heavier intervention in agriculture by sub-national governments, this will not be taken into account. An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government's orientation to the agriculture sector.            Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.            Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints.             However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe price changes.             Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.            An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A's economy is 10 times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take economic size into account.             An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure fails to take into account the relative contributions of the agricultural sector to a country's GDP. Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to C's GDP, and 10 per cent to country D's GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.            The AOI index takes into account a country's economic size, Agriculture's contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and achievable target. Nonetheless, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP. Data sources:Data on government expenditures is collected from countries using an annual questionnaire administered by FAO. Since countries typically compile government expenditure data based on their financial systems, and is administrative data covering the entirely of government expenditures, particularly at the central government level, there is no sampling issue and no possibility of sampling error. For some countries that do not report such data to FAO, data may be obtained from the IMF GFS database (which includes similar data but covering more sectors, and with less disaggregation of COFOG 042) or from official national governmental websites.       Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the system of national accounts, which is an analytical framework that compiles national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. This data is obtained from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.            Collection process:      Data for the denominator are annually collected from countries using the FAO questionnaire on Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA), developed in collaboration with the IMF. Data from countries may be supplemented, for missing countries, with data collected by the IMF, or published on official national governmental websites. The official counterpart(s) at country level are, depending on the country, from the national statistics office, the ministry of finance (or other central planning agency), or the ministry of agriculture.

"SDG_ER_GRF_PLNTSTOR","Plant breeds for which sufficient genetic resources are stored (number)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Plant breeds for which sufficient genetic resources are stored (number) The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (ex situ, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.            The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.            The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.            Plant genetic resources       The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an 'accession' is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).             Animal genetic resources       The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds (i.e.  being reported to exist only in one country) stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on 'sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed' can be found in the  Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf). Plant genetic resources Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA): Any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture. Accession An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally. Base collection A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period. Plant genetic resources      The plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or in vitro collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.            Animal genetic resources      For the animal component the indicator is calculated as the number of local breeds with enough genetic material stored within genebank collections  allowing to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of animal genetic resources, FAO, 2012, http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). Plant genetic resources      Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the 'number of accessions' as an indicator of diversity in ex situ collections:            Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.            A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.            Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring ex situ conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.             Animal genetic resources      Information on cryoconserved material in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be updated on a regular base. Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.            The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments.             The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it.             Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for, or, vice versa, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of the base collection.Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international centres together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Data sources:        Plant genetic resources: Data are sourced from officially appointed National Focal Points (NFP) (see http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/gpa/national-focal-points/en/) and regional and international agricultural research centres holding PGRFA ex situ collections. Data providers report either (i) directly to FAO by using the spreadsheet contained in document List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1 (see References) accessible from the WIEWS home page (http://www.fao.org/wiews) or (ii) through published information systems which comply with the standard of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-crop Passport Descriptor List (MCPD) v. 2 (see References), e.g. EURISCO (http://eurisco.ipk-gatersleben.de/) and Genesys (https://www.genesys-pgr.org).       Data are stored in the World Information and Early Warning System for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (WIEWS - http://www.fao.org/wiews), the FAO platform established to facilitate information exchange as well as periodic assessments of the state of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.             Animal genetic resources: National Coordinators for Management of Animal Genetic Resources, nominated by their respective government, provide data to the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) (http://dad.fao.org/). DAD-IS allows countries the storage of data on animal genetic resources being secured in either medium or long term conservation facilities as needed for the indicator.            Collection process: The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments.

Stakeholder participation Stakeholder participation is essential to ensure the sustainability of water and sanitation management options over time, e.g. the choice of appropriate solutions for a given social and economic context, and the full understanding of the impacts of a certain development decision. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability. Local administrative units Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. Policies and procedures for participation of local communities Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are 'clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs'. For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. Data on local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for local participation is being collected through the current cycle of GLAAS, and will be available by end-2016. Until then, the presence of policies and procedures as reported at the national level for different subsectors will be reported.Additional data, including data measuring local participation from the OECD Water Governance Indicators and administrative data, will be progressively included in the calculation of the indicator as they become available. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services. Data sources:The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on community and user participation has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to address all targets in SDG 6, including water quality, water rights/allocation, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). A key component of IWRM is community participation and management of water resources at the local level. The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).The OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI), a technical platform gathering 100+ members from the public, private and non-for-profit sectors, is currently developing a set of Water Governance Indicators, within the implementation strategy of the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD 2015a). The Water Governance Indicators are expected to be able to provide additional information on local participation on the basis of an indicators system proposed in OECD (2015b) for measuring 'stakeholder engagement for inclusive water governance'. An indicator providing metrics on local participation will be developed and tested by 2017. Data will be made available through interactive platforms and databases in a format to foster policy dialogue and peer learning by 2018. A dedicated publication on 'Water Governance at a Glance' will be launched at the 8th World Water Forum in Brasilia (2018).Collection process:National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process (e.g. Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment, etc. depending on country), it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation. For each GLAAS submission, information on the country processes are collected (number of ministries involved, whether a national meeting was held to support the filling of the questionnaire, stakeholder validation, use of documentation, etc.) Once received, the country submission undergoes a thorough data validation process, which is often an iterative process requiring communication and feedback with regional and country counterparts.Countries are also requested to provide consent to publish individual, validated data responses as supplied to GLAAS. Thus through the data collection, validation and consultation processes, the results are expected to be comparable and no further adjustments are foreseen.

SDG 4.2.1 was initially classified as Tier 3 and was upgraded to Tier 2 in 2019; additionally, changes to the indicator were made during the 2020 comprehensive review. In light of this and given that the ECDI2030 was officially released in March 2020, it will take some time for country uptake and implementation of the new measure and for data to become available from a sufficiently large enough number of countries. Therefore, in the meantime, a proxy indicator (children aged 36-59 months who are developmentally on-track in at least three of the following four domains: literacy-numeracy, physical, social-emotional and learning) will be used to report on 4.2.1, when relevant. This proxy indicator has been used for global SDG reporting since 2015 but is not fully aligned with the definition and age group covered by the SDG indicator formulation. When the proxy indicator is used for SDG reporting on 4.2.1 for a country, it will be footnoted as such in the global SDG database. Early childhood development (ECD) sets the stage for life-long thriving. Investing in ECD is one of the most critical and cost-effective investments a country can make to improve adult health, education and productivity in order to build human capital and promote sustainable development. ECD is equity from the start and provides a good indication of national development. Efforts to improve ECD can bring about human, social and economic improvements for both individuals and societies. Data sources:In 2015, UNICEF initiated a process of methodological development that involved extensive consultations with experts, partner agencies and national statistical authorities. Over the following five years, a sequence of carefully planned technical steps were executed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the best items to measure indicator 4.2.1. This process led to the development of the ECDI2030.The ECDI2030 addresses the need for nationally representative and internationally comparable data on early childhood development, collected in a standardized way. It captures the achievement of key developmental milestones by children between the ages of 24 and 59 months. Mothers or primary caregivers are asked 20 questions about the way their children behave in certain everyday situations, and the skills and knowledge they have acquired.The ECDI2030 can be integrated into existing national data collection efforts, including international household survey programmes such as UNICEF-supported MICS and the Demographic and Health Surveys. The ECDI2030 is meant to replace the Early Childhood Development Index (or ECDI) which collects data on the proxy indicator for SDG 4.2.1 that has been in use since 2015. The former ECDI and the new ECDI2030 target different age groups and measure slightly different development domains. Therefore, the indicators generated by both instruments may not be fully comparable and caution is needed when interpreting estimates produced by the two measures.  Collection process:	UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).		As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why.

"SDG_SH_AAP_ASMORT","Age-standardized mortality rate attributed to ambient air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Age-standardized mortality rate attributed to ambient air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population) The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years).Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age);- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years). Mortality resulting from exposure to air pollution The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes.NANA Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the model are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013). The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer were calculated using the following formula :PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative risk.The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a). An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors. As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene.Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health.

Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life. Neonatal deaths Deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of lifeNANA The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with the UN IGME-estimated under-five mortality rate. See the references for details.             For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:            Civil registration: Number of children who died during the first 28 days of life and the number of births used to calculate neonatal mortality rates.            Censuses and surveys: Censuses and surveys often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.            Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth history module.  Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. Data sources:            Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five and neonatal mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.            Civil registration      Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of neonatal mortality rates are derived from the number of neonatal deaths and number of births over a period. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.            Population census and household survey data      The majority of survey data comes from the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death.            Collection process:            For neonatal mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO.             Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of child mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UN IGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the neonatal mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data, UN IGME adjusts the neonatal mortality estimates for crisis mortality.            Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices, and to Ministries of Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data.            To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal: CME (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates.

'Improved' sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Population with a basic handwashing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household. Improved sanitation facilities Improved sanitation facilities include the following: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Safely disposed in situ When pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied, the excreta may still remain isolated from human contact and can be considered safely managed. For example, with the new SDG indicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a common practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services. Treated offsite Not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment site. For instance, a portion may leak from the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. Similarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to open ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once the excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment equipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of SDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will initially be assessed based on the reported level of treatment. Method of computation: Household surveys and censuses provide data on use of types of basic sanitation facilities listed above, as well as the presence of handwashing materials in the home. The percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services is calculated by combining data on the proportion of the population using different types of basic sanitation facilities with estimates of the proportion of faecal waste which is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. The JMP estimates use of basic sanitation facilities for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression model to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of 'improved sanitation' facilities for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available.The JMP 2017 update and SDG baselines report describes in more detail how estimates of the proportion of household wastewater that is safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site have been combined with data on use of different types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the JMP global database. A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. Data on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017.Presence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. Data were available for 70 countries in 2017. MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to 'basic sanitation'. The JMP developed the metric of use of 'improved' sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards.The above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or the transport and treatment of wastes at a designated treatment site. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment).Handwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In 2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that the most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household surveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the presence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether households have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by survey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing behaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour. Data sources:Access to water and sanitation are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, and key determinants of child survival, maternal, and children's health, family wellbeing, and economic productivity. Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to sanitation is therefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,700 surveys and censuses. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not always collect information on basic access, data are drawn from administrative records.Estimates of excreta management will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of basic sanitation facilities as needed. Administrative, population and environmental data can also be combined to estimate safe disposal or transport of excreta, when no country data are available. Data on disposal or treatment of excreta are limited but estimates for safe management of faecal wastes can be calculated based on faecal waste flows associated with the use of different types of basic sanitation facility.Since the handwashing with soap survey questions were standardized in 2009, over 70 DHS and MICS surveys have included the module. JMP published handwashing estimates for 12 countries in its 2014 update, for 54 countries in its 2015 update, and for 70 countries in its 2017 update.The population data used by JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those established by the UN Population Division.Collection process:WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing, all JMP estimates undergo rigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations give rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services and the monitoring systems that collect these data. The JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any.

"SDG_SI_POV_DAY1","Proportion of population below international poverty line (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of population below international poverty line (%) The proportion of the employed population below the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day, also referred to as the working poverty rate, is defined as the share of employed persons living in households with per-capita consumption or income that is below the international poverty line of US$1.90. Employment  Poverty Line  Working poor  Working poverty rate= (Employed persons living on less than US$ 1.90 a day / Total employment) x 100 At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such factors as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of PPPs rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the same degree of need.         Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to households, and not to individuals, based on the assumption that households pool their income. This assumption may not always be true.         Moreover, the poverty status of a household is a function of the wage and other employment-related income secured by those household members in employment, income derived from asset ownership, plus any other available income such as transfer payments and the number of household members. Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her own income, the income of other household members and the number of household members who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to study household structure in relation to working poverty. In order to eradicate poverty, we must understand the root causes of poverty. The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed population living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift them and their families out of poverty and ensure decent living conditions. The adequacy of earnings is a fundamental aspect of job quality, and these deficits in job quality could be keeping workers and their families in poverty. The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light on the relationship between employment and household poverty. Data sources: The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can reliably identify both the poverty status of households and the economic activity of the household's members. Examples include household income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys (LSMS) with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same observation period.         Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour force survey may, however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire design. Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the best instrument for collecting household income or consumption expenditure data, although an attached income module can be designed to achieve statistically reliable results, including ensuring an overlap in the observation period between household income (or consumption expenditure) and employment status.         Another possibility is to combine data from a household income and expenditure survey and from a separate labour force survey when the respondent households can be matched and consistency in the long observation period between the surveys can be obtained.

The first component is that transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction cost should be intended as 'Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent'. This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less. International remittance transfer A cross-border person-to-person payment of relatively low value. The transfers are typically recurrent payments by migrant workers (who send money to their families in their home country every month). In the report, the term 'remittance transfer' is used for simplicity (ie it is assumed the transfer is international). Remittance service A service that enables end users to send and/or receive remittance transfers. Remittance service provider (RSP) An entity, operating as a business, that provides a remittance service for a price to end users, either directly or through agents. These include both banks and money transfer operators, as defined below. Data is collected through a mystery shopping exercise of remittance service providers (RSPs). A sample of RSPs including at least 80% of the market share in each corridor are included in the mystery shopping exercise. The average cost is calculated as the simple average of total costs (including both fee and exchange rate margin) quoted by each RSP operating in a corridor.In 2016, introduced the Smart Remitter Target (SmarRT) to monitor remittance transactions at a more granular level. It aims to reflect the cost that a savvy consumer with access to sufficiently complete information would pay to transfer remittances in each corridor. SmaRT is calculated as the simple average as the three cheapest services for sending the equivalent of $200 in each corridor and is expressed in terms of the percentage of the total amount sent. In addition to transparency, services must meet additional criteria to be included in SmaRT, including transaction speed (5 days or less) and accessibility (determined by geographic proximity of branches for services that require physical presence, or access to any technology or device necessary to use the service, such as a bank account, mobile phone or the internet. For additional information on the methodology of SmaRT, please see: https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/smart_methodology.pdf Target 10.c.1 includes two components, which require two separate calculations:1.	Global average of remittance costs to be reduced to less than 3 percent: this is calculated as the simple average of the total cost for all services included in the RPW database2.	Enabling remittance senders in all corridors to send money to their receivers at a cost of 5 percent or less: this is calculated as the average cost of the three cheapest available services in each corridor which meet a defined set of minimum requirements, as described in the World Bank SmaRT methodology. The target is that the SmaRT average for all corridors should be 5 percent or lower.  Data for these indicators have been collected by the World Bank through the Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) database since 2008 for the purpose of monitoring the G8 / G20 target on reducing remittance prices. Also known as the '5x5 objective', this goal was adopted by the G8 in 2009, and it refers to reduction of the global average total cost of migrant remittances by 5 percentage points in 5 years. To achieve this objective, the governments in both sending and receiving countries should consider implementing reforms based upon the General Principles for International Remittances Services by the World Bank/Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (January 2007). This internationally agreed framework has proven effective in helping reduce the cost of remittances and guiding actions to enhance the efficiency of international remittances. The World Bank’s RPW database is the only global database that monitors remittance prices across all regions of the world. RPW was launched by the World Bank in September 2008, and is a key tool in monitoring the evolution of costs to the remitters and the beneficiaries from sending and receiving money in major country corridors. Data sources:Data sources are the remittance service providers (RSPs) themselves. Data are collected quarterly through a mystery shopping exercise, which takes one week. Every year, in each corridor, a market analysis is conducted to compile a sample of RSPs covering at least 80% of the market. Collection process: Mystery shopping conducted quarterly.

Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'. Unpaid domestic and care work Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'. Productive activity An activity is said to be productive or to fall within the 'general production boundary' if it satisfies the third-person criterion (the activity can be delegated to another person and yield the same desired results).Productive activities can be further classified based on the ILO framework for work statistics (included in the 19th ICLS resolution) into:a)	Own-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)b)	Employment (activities to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit)c)	Unpaid trainee work (any unpaid activity to produce goods or provide services for others, in order to acquire workplace experience or skills in a trade or profession)d)	Volunteer work (any unpaid, non-compulsory activity to produce goods or provide services for others)e)	Other forms of workThe own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.Indicator 5.4.1 only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'.As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.NA Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day. Weekly data is averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated by dividing the daily average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work by 24 hours. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated as:Indicator 5.4.1 = ((daily number of hours spent on domestic work + daily number of hours spent on core work) / 24) * 100If data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain daily time spent.Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. SDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. Time use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: a)	Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity.  b)	Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. c)	Time-use data presented refer to the 'main activity' only. Any 'secondary activity' performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. d)	Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.  Data sources:Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level.Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection.Collection process:The official counterparts at the country level are the national statistical offices. Data are compiled and validated. If there are inconsistencies or issues with the data, UNSD consults the focal point in the national statistical office.

"SDG_SL_EMP_GTOTL","Labour share of GDP (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Labour share of GDP (%) Labour share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total compensation of employees and the labour income of the self-employed given as a percent of GDP, which is a measure of total output. It provides information about the relative share of output which accrues to workers as compared with the share that accrues to capital in the production process for a given reference period. Compensation of employees Compensation of employees is the total in-cash or in-kind remuneration payable to the employee by the enterprise for the work performed by the employee during the accounting period. Compensation of employees includes: (i) wages and salaries (in cash or in kind) and (ii) social insurance contributions payable by employers. This concept views compensation of employees as a cost to employer, thus compensation equals zero for unpaid work undertaken voluntarily. Moreover, it does not include taxes payable by employers on the wage and salary bill, such as payroll tax.The indicator should be produced using data that cover all economic activities, all employees, and all self-employed. Thus, in addition to the compensation of employees, the indicator should also include the labour income of the self-employed. Gross domestic product (GDP) Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the market value of all final goods and services produced during a specific time period (for the purposes of this indicator, one year) in a country's territory. Persons in employment Persons in employment are defined as all those persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.. Persons in employment include employees and self-employed. Labour share of Gross Domestic Product = (Total compensation of employees + Labour income of the self-employed) / Gross Domestic Product * 100 GDP may exclude or underreport activities that are difficult to measure, such as transactions in the informal sector or in illegal markets, etc. thus understating the GDP. Moreover, GDP does not account for the social and environmental costs of production, and is therefore is not a good measure of the level of over-all wellbeing. Labour share of GDP seeks to inform about the relative share of GDP which accrues to workers as compared to the share which accrues to capital in a given reference period. In order to interpret this indicator effectively, it is important to consider it together with economic growth trends. The share of labour compensation in national output can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher incomes for employees over time (and/or higher earnings for the self-employed). In periods of economic recession, the labour income share provides an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces labour income relative to profits. If labour income falls at a greater rate than profits, the labour income share will be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline in profits than in labour income, the share will rise. For any given level of GDP and profits, the labour income share can fall as a result of falling wages, falling earnings of the self-employed, changes in the composition of employment by income or a combination these.Increased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals in the economy, but this will depend on the distribution of real income and public policy among other factors. If there is a large number of non-resident border or seasonal workers or inflows and outflows of property income such that the value of production differs from the income of residents, there may be a situation of over or understating the living standards of residents. Data sources:The recommended primary data sources for this indicator are the national accounts estimates of GDP and compensation of employees. The periodicity of this indicator will hence depend on the national accounts data produced in the given country. For self-employed workers an imputation model needs to be developed to account for their labour income, in combination with national accounts data. The source of the data should be presented when providing estimates of the indicator, as well as the System of National Accounts revision (preferably the SNA 2008).

"SDG_SN_ITK_DEFC","Prevalence of undernourishment (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Prevalence of undernourishment (%) The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (French: pourcentage de sous-alimentation; Spanish: porcentaje de sub-alimentaciÃ³n; Italian: prevalenza di sotto-alimentazione) is an estimate of the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage. Undernourishment Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements.             Though strictly related, 'undernourishment' as defined here is different from the physical conditions of 'malnutrition' and 'undernutrition' as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, alimentaciÃ³n, or alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutriciÃ³n or nutrizione, in the name of the indicator. A more appropriate expression in English that would render the precise meaning of the indicator might have been 'prevalence of under-feeding' but by now the term 'undernourishment' has long been associated with the indicator.             While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished.NANA The indicator is computed at the population level. To this aim, the population is represented by an 'average' individual for which a probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy intake levels is modelled through a parametric probability density function (pdf).       Once the pdf is characterized, the indicator is obtained as the cumulative probability that daily habitual dietary energy intakes (x) are below the lower bound of the range of normal dietary energy requirements for that representative, or average individual (MDER)              See https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-01-01.pdf for detailed methodology. Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic over time, of the same individual.             The model based approach to estimate the PoU developed by FAO integrates information that is available with sufficient regularity from different sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor progress towards reducing global hunger.             Further specific consideration             1.	Feasibility       Estimation of PoU at national level has been feasible for most countries in the world since 1999. In the worst case scenario, when no data on food consumption was available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC) from Food Balance Sheets (FBS), an indirect estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) based on information on the country's GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country's Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) based on the UN Population Division's World Population Prospects data.             2.	Reliability       Reliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the estimation of the model's parameters.       DEC could be estimated either from survey data or from food balances. Neither source is devoid of problems. When comparing estimates of national DEC from FBS and from surveys, differences are frequently noted.       DEC estimates from survey data can be affected by systematic measurement errors due to under-reporting of food consumption, or to incomplete recording of all food consumption sources. Recent research shows that a negative bias of up to more than 850 kcal can be induced on the estimated daily per capita caloric consumption can be induced by the type of food consumption module chosen to capture the data at the household level. (See De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf ). A detailed analysis of a recent Household Budget Survey in Brazil revealed how food provided for free through the school meals program and consumed by children while at school, had not been accounted among the sources of household food consumption, accounting for a downward bias of the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption of 674 kcal. (See Borlizzi, Cafiero & Del Grossi, forthcoming.)       DEC estimates from Food Balance Sheets can also be affected by errors, though it is difficult to establish the direction of induced bias. As average food availability is a residual in the FBS method, any errors in reported production, trade, and stocks might affect the estimates of national food availability. Moreover, errors might be induced by the difficulty in properly accounting for all forms of food commodity utilization. To the extent that all these errors are uncorrelated, though, the impact on the estimated average food consumption will be lower than each of the errors, considered separately, might imply. Nevertheless, considering how problematic it is to precisely account for variations in national reserves of food commodities, for which official data may be unreliable, it is recognized that the estimated annual stock variation is prone to considerable uncertainty that would be transferred to the estimated DEC in each given year.       To limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented estimates of PoU at national level as three-year averages, on the presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average over three consecutive years.       Survey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness. As described in the section of metadata on the method of computation, unless obtained from high quality individual dietary intake surveys, data needs to be treated to reduce the likely upward bias in the estimates of the CV that would be induced by the spurious variability due to errors in measuring individual habitual dietary energy intake.             3.	Comparability       If the same method of computation is used, comparability across time and space is relatively high, with the only potential cause of inhomogeneity found in the different quality of the background data.             4.	Limitations       Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of uncertainty associated with estimates of each of the parameters in the model, the precision of the PoU estimates is generally low. Even though it is not possible to compute theoretical Margins of Error (MoE) for PoU estimates, these would very likely exceed plus or minus 2.5% in most cases. For this reason, FAO publishes national level PoU estimates only when they are larger than 2.5%. This also suggests that 2.5% is the lowest feasible target that can be set for the PoU indicator, a value that is unsatisfactorily large when the ambition is to fully eradicate the scourge of hunger.       If no survey is available that collects food consumption data and that is representative at subnational level, the indicator can only be computed at national level. The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999. It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households' ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time.             The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimated for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe condition of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal that aims at reducing hunger. Data sources: The ideal source of data to estimate the PoU would be a carefully designed and skillfully conducted individual dietary intake survey, in which actual daily food consumption, together with heights and weights for each surveyed individual, are repeatedly measured on a sample that is representative of the target population. Due to their cost, however, such surveys are rare.            In principle, a well-designed household survey that collects information on food acquisitions might be sufficient to inform a reliable estimate of the Prevalence of Undernourishment in a population, at a reasonable cost and with the necessary periodicity to inform the SDG monitoring process, provided that:             a)	All sources of food consumption for all members of the households are properly accounted for, including, in particular, food that is consumed away from home;       b)	Sufficient information is available to convert the data on food consumption or on food expenditures into their contribution to dietary energy intake;       c)	The proper methods to compute the PoU are used, to control for excess variability in the estimated levels of habitual food consumption across households, allowing for the presence on normal variability in the distribution of food consumption across individuals, induced by the differences in energy requirements of the members of the population.             Examples of surveys that could be considered for this purpose include surveys conducted to compute economic statistics and conduct poverty assessments, such as Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, Household Budget Surveys and Living Standard Measurement Surveys.             In practice, however, it is often impossible, and not advisable, to rely only on data collected through a household survey, as the information needed to estimate the four parameters of the PoU model is either missing or imprecise.             Household Survey food consumption data often must be integrated by       a) Data on the demographic structure of the population of interest by sex and age;       b) Data or information on the median height of individuals in each sex and age class;       c) Data on the distribution of physical activity levels in the population;       d) Alternative data on the total amounts of food available for human consumption, to correct for biases in the estimate of the national average daily dietary energy consumption in the population.             Data for a), b) and c) could be available through the same multipurpose survey that provides food consumption data, but are more likely available from other sources, such as National Demographic and Health Surveys (for a) and b) ) and Time Use Surveys (for c) ).             Correcting for bias in the estimated average daily dietary energy consumption might need to be based on alternative sources on food consumption, such as aggregate food supply and utilization accounts and food balance sheets.             To inform its estimate of PoU at national, regional and global level, in addition to all household surveys for which it is possible to obtain micro data on food consumption, FAO relies on:       a) UN Population Division's World Population Prospects (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/), which provide updated estimates of the structures of the national population by sex and age every two years for most countries in the world;       b) FAO Food Balance Sheets (http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E), which provides updated estimates of the national availability of food every year for most countries in the world.            Micro data from household surveys that collect food consumption data are sourced by FAO directly through the National Statistical Agencies' websites, or through specific bilateral agreements.             Collection process: Official information on food commodity production, trade and utilization used by FAO to compile Food Balance Sheets is provided mainly by Statistical Units of the Ministry of Agriculture. FAO sends out a data collection questionnaire every year to an identified focal point.               Microdata of household surveys are generally owned and provided by National Statistical Agencies. When available, data is sourced by FAO directly through the NSA' website. In several cases, when microdata is not available in the public domain, bilateral agreements have been signed, usually in the contexts of technical assistance and capacity development programs.               Data on the population size and structure for all monitored countries is obtained from the UN Population Division's World Population Prospects.

Specifically, Indicator 7.1.1 refers to the proportion of population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per country, as well as by UN regional and global classifications. Electricity access Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of population in the considered area (country, region or global context) that has access to consistent sources of electricity.The World Bank's Global Electrification Database compiles nationally representative household survey data as well as census data from 1990 to 2018. It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys. At the time of this analysis, the Global Electrification Database contained 1,215 surveys from 140 countries, excluding surveys from high-income countries as classified by the United Nations.NANA The World Bank's Global Electrification Database compiles nationally representative household survey data as well as census data from 1990 to 2018. It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys. At the time of this analysis, the Global Electrification Database contained 1,215 surveys from 140 countries, excluding surveys from high-income countries as classified by the United Nations.To estimate values, a multilevel nonparametric modelling approach-developed by the World Health Organization to estimate clean fuel usage-was adapted to predict electricity access and used to fill in the missing data points for the time period between 1990 and 2018. Where data is available, access estimates are weighted by population. Multilevel nonparametric modelling considers the hierarchical structure of data (country and regional levels), using the regional classification of the United Nations. The model is applied for all countries with at least one data point. In order to use as much real data as possible, results based on real survey data are reported in their original form for all years available. The statistical model is used to fill in data only for years where they are missing and to conduct global and regional analyses. In the absence of survey data for a given year, information from regional trends was borrowed. The difference between real data points and estimated values is clearly identified in the database.  Countries considered 'Developed' by the United Nations and classified as 'High Income' are assumed to have electrification rates of 100 percent from the first year the country joined the category. In the present report, to avoid having electrification trends from 1990 to 2010 overshadow electrification efforts since 2010, the model was run twice: - With survey data + assumptions from 1990-2018 for model estimates from 1990-2018 - With survey data + assumptions from 2010-2018 for model estimates from 2010-2018 Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, several countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modelling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points. This modelling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these time periods. The SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) referenced below provides more details on the suggested methodology for tracking access to energy (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 82-87). The World Bank aims to estimate demand side access rates in order to better understand the access levels experienced by the population. This is different from the supply side access rates usually provided by governments, ministries, etc. The data collected is compiled from national household surveys and censuses. But since these are carried out infrequently, it is difficult to understand the ground level trends for short term periods. Collecting data for rural areas as well as last-mile connectivity problems also cause errors in data collection that could skew results. While the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking household energy access, it also presents several limitations that will need to be addressed over time. In many parts of the world, the presence of an electricity connection in the household does not necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate in quality and reliability or affordable in cost and it would be desirable to have fuller information about these critical attributes of the service, which have been highlighted in SDG7.Substantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture these broader dimensions of service quality and would make it possible to go beyond a simple yes/no measure of energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes different levels of energy access, and also takes into account the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous international agencies working in the field. Discussions are also progressing with the World Bank's Household Survey Technical Working Group regarding the mainstreaming of this methodology into the standardized household questionnaire design that will be applied every three years in all low-income countries between 2015 and 2030 as part of the broader SDG monitoring exercise.The adoption of this methodology will allow - over time - the more refined measurement of energy access, making it possible to report more disaggregated information regarding the type of electricity supply (grid or off-grid), the capacity of electricity supply provided (in Watts), the duration of service (daily hours and evening hours), the reliability of service (in terms of number and length of unplanned service interruptions), the quality of service (in terms of voltage fluctuations), as well as affordability and legality of service.Another advantage of this approach is that they can be applied not only to measuring energy access at the household level, but also its availability to support enterprises and deliver critical community services, such as health and education.Methodological challenges associated with the measurement of energy access are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (2013) (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 75-82), and in the ESMAP (2015) Report 'Beyond Connections: Energy Access Redefined' both of which are referenced below. Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development of income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks.Under the global target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses specifically on electricity access available to the global population. In order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the primary source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar systems, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles, batteries, etc., are not considered due to their limited working capacities and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting. Data SourcesDescription:Data for access to electricity is collected from household surveys and censuses, tapping into a wide number of different household survey types including: Multi-tier Framework (MTF), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, including those by various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).The World Bank is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a meta-database of statistics on electricity access harvested from the full global body of household surveys. The World Bank Electrification Database covers more than 220 countries for the period 1990-2018 and is updated regularly.For more information on compiling access to energy data see Global Tracking Framework report (2013) (Chapter 2, Annex 2, page 127-129).Reports produced by international agencies such as the UN, World Bank, USAID, National Statistics Offices, as well as country censuses are used to collect data.

"SDG_EG_FEC_RNEW","Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%) The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. Renewable energy consumption Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. Comments with regard to specific renewable energy resources: - Solar energy consumption includes solar PV and solar thermal. - Liquid biofuel energy consumption includes biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels. - Solid biofuel consumption includes fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal. - Waste energy covers energy from renewable municipal waste.NANA This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources - statistics used to produce a national energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described in the 'International Recommendations for Energy Statistics' (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/methodology/ires .Once a national energy balance is developed, the indicator can be calculated by dividing final energy consumption from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively. For instance, if total final consumption table reports 150 TJ for biogas energy, while total final consumption of electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of biogas in total electricity output is 10 percent and 5 percent in heat, the total reported number for biogas consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%). The Global Tracking Framework Report (IEA and World Bank, 2013) provides more details on the suggested methodology for defining and measuring renewable energy (Chapter 4, Section 1, page 201-202). UNSD follows the same methodology to compute the indicators, though information may come from different tables. - A limitation with existing renewable energy statistics is that they are not able to distinguish whether renewable energy is being sustainably produced. For example, a substantial share of today's renewable energy consumption comes from the use of wood and charcoal by households in the developing world, which sometimes may be associated with unsustainable forestry practices. There are efforts underway to improve the ability to measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a significant challenge. - Off-grid renewables data are limited and not sufficiently captured in the energy statistics - The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same between all technologies. However, this is not always true because renewables are usually located in more remote areas from consumption centers and may incur larger losses. - Likewise, imports and exports of electricity and heat are assumed to follow the share of renewability of electricity and heat generation, respectively. This is a simplification that in many cases will not affect the indicator too much, but that might do so in some cases, for example, when a country only generates electricity from fossil fuels but imports a great share of the electricity it uses from a neighboring country's hydroelectric power plant. - Methodological challenges associated with defining and measuring renewable energy are more fully described in the Global Tracking Framework (IEA and World Bank, 2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, pages 194-200. Data for traditional use of solid biofuels are generally scarce globally, and developing capacity in tracking such energy use, including developing national level surveys, is essential for sound global energy tracking. The target 'By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix' impacts all three dimensions of sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical global problem of climate change. A number of definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in common is highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their consumption does not deplete their availability in the future. These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain. Data sources:Data on renewable energy consumption are available through national energy balances compiled based on data collected by the International Energy Agency (for around 150 countries) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) for all countries. The energy balances make it possible to trace all the different sources and uses of energy at the national level. Some technical assistance may be needed to improve these statistics, particularly in the case of renewable energy sources. Specialized industry surveys (e.g. on bioenergy use) or household surveys (in combination with the measurement of other indicators) would be feasible approaches to filling in data gaps (e.g. for use of firewood, off-grid solar energy). Indicator release: 2020.Q4.G.02 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Goal 7 seeks to promote broader energy access and increased use of renewable energy, including through enhanced international cooperation and expanded infrastructure and technology for clean energy.

Ownership of mobile cellular phone An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded. Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that has been used in the last three months. Mobile (cellular) telephone A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provides access to the PSTN. This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included.NA Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household surveys. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope individuals who own a mobile phone by the total number of in-scope individuals. While the data on the 'proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone' currently only exist for very few countries, ITU is encouraging all countries to collect data on this indicator through national household surveys and the indicator is expected to be added to the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators. The number of countries with official data for this indicator is expected to increase in the near future. Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last decade and the number of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number of the people living on earth. However, not every person uses, or owns a mobile-cellular telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for professional purposes. A number of studies have highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth.Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that less women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile phone ownership to track and to improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender divide. The collection of this indicator was proposed by the Task Group on Gender of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development. Data sources: This indicator is a newly developed ITU indicator that was approved by the World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium (WTIS) 2014. The indicator's definition and methodology were developed under the coordination of ITU, through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. Data for the proportion of individuals owning a mobile phone were first collected in 2015, through an annual questionnaire that ITU sends to national statistical offices (NSO). In this questionnaire, through which ITU already collects a number of ICT indicators, ITU collects absolute values. The percentages are calculated a-posteriori. The survey methodology is verified to ensure that it meets adequate statistical standards. The data are verified to ensure consistency with previous years' data and other relevant country-level indicators (ICT and economic).Data are usually not adjusted, but discrepancies in the definition, age scope of individuals, reference period or the break in comparability between years are noted in a data note. For this reason, data are not always strictly comparable.Collection process:ITU collects data on this indicator through an annual questionnaire that it sends to the heads of the national statistical offices (NSO).

Real GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or area. The data for real GDP are measured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of country growth rates and aggregation of the country data. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the monetary value of final goods and services-that is, those that are bought by the final user-produced in an economic territory country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year). It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. GDP can be measured using the expenditure approach as the sum of expenditure on final consumption plus gross capital formation plus exports less imports, the production approach as the value of output less intermediate consumption plus any taxes less subsidies on products not already included in the value of output, or the income approach as compensation of employees plus gross operating surplus plus gross mixed incomes plus taxes less subsidies on both production and imports.NANA The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as follows:a.	Convert annual real GDP in domestic currency at 2015 prices for a country or area to US dollars at 2015 prices using the 2015 exchange rates.b.	Divide the result by the population of the country or area to obtain annual real GDP per capita in constant US dollars at 2015 prices.c.	Calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in year t+1 using the following formula: [(G(t+1) - G(t))/G(t)] x 100, where G(t+1) is real GDP per capita in 2015 US dollars in year t+1 and G(t) is real GDP per capita in 2015 US dollars in year t. Although countries or areas calculate GDP using the common principles and recommendations in the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), there are still problems in international comparability of GDP estimates. These include:a.	Different versions of the SNA (for example, 1968, 1993 or 2008) countries or areas use in calculating their GDP estimatesb.	Different degree of coverage of informal and non-observed economic activities in the GDP estimatesFurther, as a necessary condition to being a key economic performance indicator of sustainable development, one of the often-cited limitations of GDP is that it does not account for the social and environmental costs of production. It is designed as a measure of the level of overall well-being. For example, growth in real GDP per capita reveals nothing concerning energy and material interactions with the environment. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a proxy for the average standard of living of residents in a country or area.A positive percentage change in annual real GDP per capita can be interpreted as an increase in the average standard of living of the residents in a country or area. Data sources:The underlying annual GDP estimates in domestic currency are collected from countries or areas annually through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ), while the underlying population estimates areobtained from the UN Population Division on https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/Collection process:Each year, the national accounts section of the UNSD sends a pre-filled NAQ to countries or areas to collect the latest data on official annual national accounts in domestic currency. In order to lighten the reporting burden of countries to different international and regional organizations the UNSD receives data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on behalf of their constituents.The official national accounts data in domestic currency are then validated to check for errors. The validation procedure involves ensuring that aggregates are equal to the sum of their components and that data series which are provided in multiple tables are represented consistently. After that, the current and constant price GDP series are converted into US dollars by applying the corresponding market exchange rates as reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When these conversion rates are not available other IMF rates are used (official rates or principal rates).For countries whose exchange rates are not reported by the IMF, the annual average of United Nations operational rates of exchange (UNOPs) is applied. The UNOPs are conversion rates that are applied in official transactions of the United Nations with these countries. These exchange rates are based on official, commercial and/or tourist rates of exchange.In cases where a country experiences considerable distortion in the conversion rates, the UNSD uses price-adjusted rates of exchange (PARE) as an alternative to the exchange rates reported by the IMF or UN operational rates of exchange. The conversion based on PARE corrects the distorting effects of uneven price changes that are not well reflected in the other conversion rates. Consequently, unrealistic levels in GDP and other national accounts aggregates expressed in US Dollars may have been adjusted for certain time periods to improve the economic analysis at national, regional and local levels.The estimates derived for each year are compared to previous years to ensure that estimates are prepared consistently from year to year. Additionally, the growth rate from year to year is analysed to identify anomalies in the data.The constant-price GDP series for each country is then divided by its population to obtain its real GDP per capita.More information on the methodology to estimate the data is available on https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf Indicator release: 2020.Q4.G.02 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 8 aims to provide opportunities for full and productive employment and decent work for all while eradicating forced labour, human trafficking and child labour.

This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of members of parliament.INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the proportion of positions held by women in local government.It is expressed as a percentage of elected positions held by women in legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government. Seats (5.5.1a) Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election. Local government (5.5.1b) Local government is one of the sub-national spheres of government and a result of decentralization, a process of transferring political, fiscal, and administrative powers from the central government to sub-national units of government distributed across the territory of a country to regulate and/or run certain government functions or public services on their own. The definition of local government follows the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) distinction between central, state, and local government (para 4.129). Local government consists of local government units, defined in the SNA as 'institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes' (para 4.145). What constitutes local government of a given country is defined by that country's national legal framework, including national constitutions and local government acts or equivalent legislation.Each local government unit typically includes a legislative/ deliberative body and an executive body. Legislative/ deliberative bodies, such as councils or assemblies, are formal entities with a prescribed number of members as per national or state legislation. They are usually elected by universal suffrage and have decision-making power, including the ability to issue by-laws, on a range of local aspects of public affairs. Executive bodies, consisting of an executive committee or a mayor, may be elected, appointed or nominated and they prepare and execute decisions made by the legislative/ deliberative body. Elected positions are the most common manner of selection of local government members. They are selected in local elections, based on a system of choosing political office holders in which the voters cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The category of elected positions includes both elected persons who competed on openly contested seats and persons selected during the electoral processes on reserved seats or through a candidate quota.By comparison, members selected on appointed positions (the least common manner of selection of local government members) are nominated, typically by government officials from higher-ranking tiers of government. Appointed members of local government are more frequent among the leadership positions, such as the heads of the executive body, representatives of specific groups (e.g., women, disadvantaged groups, youth); and, temporary committees/delegations/caretakers appointed by government officials when a council has been dissolved.NA INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament.There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)The method of computation is as follows:Indicator 5.5.1(b) = (Number of seats held by women * 100) / Total number of seats held by women and men (unit: %) INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking.- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women's contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) refers to the representation of women among elected positions of legislative/deliberative bodies of local government. This is a strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, and mirrors the SDG indicator measuring women's representation at national level, in parliament. This is also a limitation in that the indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local government officials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously holding a position within the legislative/deliberative body, or who are appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator. It is recommended that women's representation in executive positions, particularly at the level of the head of the executive (such as mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels, but not as a headline SDG indicator.Importantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of local government and not the quality of their participation. Countries may therefore consider assessing political participation through national or subnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research. Additional indicators of political participation may also be monitored at national level, such as women's share among voters and candidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps on women's political participation.  Finally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of local government, such as public administration staff, are not included in the indicator 5.5.1(b), and may be covered by other indicators in the SDG framework, particularly within the Goal 16 on inclusive societies. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision making. Women's participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women's opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women's empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies.Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women's participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women's access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase women's shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)        Women's and men's right to exercise their political rights on an equal basis, and at all levels of decision-making, is recognized in the SDGs and enshrined in many human and political rights declarations, conventions and resolutions agreed to by most countries in the world. Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the degree to which gender balance has been achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in local government. Indicator 5.5.1(b) complements the Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in national parliaments, and accounts for the representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are covered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a): Data sources:The data used are official statistics received from parliaments. The data are provided by national parliaments and updated after an election or parliamentary renewal. National parliaments also transmit their data to the IPU at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat. After each general election or renewal a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliament. INDICATOR 5.5.1(b): Data sources:Administrative data based on electoral records are the main source of data on elected members of local government, and the recommended data source for Indicator 5.5.1(b). Electoral records are produced and upheld by Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) or equivalent bodies tasked with organizing elections at local level. EMBs are part of the National Statistical System, and often specifically mentioned in the national statistics acts as producers of official statistics. The use of electoral records to measure women's representation in local government and monitoring of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is cost-effective, straightforward and timely. No adjustments or estimates are necessary to transform the administrative information into statistics for monitoring the indicator. The conceptual framework at the basis of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is consistent with the conceptual framework at the basis of local elections, as both are provided by national legal framework. The data used to calculate Indicator 5.5.1(b) refer to information on election winners, disaggregated by sex, and the coverage of the reference population (in this case, the elected officials) should be complete. In countries where the electoral records are electronic and centralized, information on numbers of women and men in elected positions can be made available as soon as the official results of elections are released. Two other types of sources of data may be used in the few instances where electoral records are not electronic or not centralized. One additional type of source is also administrative, and refers to public administration data available to line ministries overseeing local government. However, its use for statistics may be less straightforward compared to centralized electoral records. The scope of public administration records is beyond the elected positions, and information on women and men in elected positions of local government may be mixed with information on public administration employees, which are not covered by this indicator. Therefore, additional data processing and resources may be required to carefully extract the information needed. In some cases, the forms used as the basis for administrative records may need to be modified to ensure recording of the positions as being elected, in legislative/deliberative bodies, as well as the sex of persons in those positions. In other cases, some elected positions may not be covered in the records maintained, for example, if the administrative records are restricted to only those positions that are on the government payroll. Another type of data source that may provide information on women and men in local government in the absence of centralized electronic election records, refers to existing surveys or censuses using local government units as units of observation. These surveys or censuses may be undertaken by National Statistical Offices and/or line ministries and may take the form of (a) local government censuses or surveys; (b) establishment survey; and (c) municipality surveys. These surveys/census may already include, in the data collection tool dedicated to their main purpose, a few questions on the number of members of local legislative/deliberative and executive bodies by sex and other individual characteristics such as age and education; or may require the integration of such questions. Similar to other censuses and surveys, a low response rate can result in bias of the statistics obtained. Sampling errors may also add to the bias, in ways that cannot be assessed in the absence of a good understanding of distribution of women's and men's representation across different local government units across the territory of a country.Collection process:The compilation of data, coordinated by UN Women and undertaken with the support of UN Regional Commissions, uses two mechanisms:-	data request forms sent to EMBs and NSOs directly or through UN Regional Commissions -	on-line dissemination of data by NSS entities who are the primary source of data or in charge with coordination of SDGs, including EMBs and/or NSOs. This process will be done in a transparent manner, based on communication with NSS focal points, so that the NSS has a chance to validate or dismiss a country's compiled data.

"SDG_SH_DYN_MORTN","Under-five deaths (number)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Under-five deaths (number) Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Under-five mortality rate The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.NANA The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from national data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. In most cases, the UN IGME estimates are close to the underlying data. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for all countries. See references for details.             For the underlying data mentioned above, the most frequently used methods are as follows:            Civil registration: The under-five mortality rate can be derived from a standard period abridged life table using the age-specific deaths and mid-year population counts from civil registration data to calculate death rates, which are then converted into age-specific probabilities of dying.            Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on a summary birth history, a series of questions asked of each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under-five and infant mortality rates. Censuses often include questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.            Surveys: A direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child and under-five mortality estimates can be derived from the full birth history module.  Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. Data sources:            Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system that records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases, household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary sources of data on under-five mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.            Civil registration      Civil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of the under-five and infant mortality rates from civil registration data is derived from a standard period abridged life table. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.            Population census and household survey data      The majority of survey data comes in one of two forms: the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death; and the summary birth history (SBH), whereby women are asked only about the number of their children ever born and the number that have died (or equivalently the number still alive).            Collection process:            For under-five mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publicly and then conduct data quality assessment. UNICEF also collects data through UNICEF country offices by reaching national counterpart(s). The UN IGME also collects vital registration data reported by Ministries of Health or other relevant agencies to WHO.             Adjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of under-five mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UNIGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the under-five mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data, UN IGME adjusts the estimates for crisis mortality.            Then the UN IGME conducts an annual country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices and to Ministries of Health or relevant agencies for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Health or relevant agencies review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data, send feedback or comments, and sometimes supply additional empirical data.            To increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality web portal: CME (www.childmortality.org). It includes all available data and shows estimates for each country. Once the new estimates are finalized, CME will be updated to reflect all available data and the new estimates.

The indicator is also referred to as the demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods. Women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning.  Contraceptive prevalence Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. Modern or traditional contraception For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately. The numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning).                Demand satisfied by modern methods = Number of women who are currently using a modern method of contraception / Number of women who are using any method of contraception or are having an unmet need for family planning Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by 'currently using' a method of contraception.In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (by age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analysing trends over time.When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for married or in-union women is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), or ever-married women. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not representative of women of reproductive age. The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low. Data sources: This indicator is calculated from nationally-representative household survey data. Multi-country survey programmes that include relevant data for this indicator are: Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (CPS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 surveys (PMA), World Fertility Surveys (WFS), other international survey programmes and national surveys.For information on the source of each estimate, see United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2020).

"SDG_SH_HAP_MORT","Crude death rate attributed to household air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Crude death rate attributed to household air pollution (deaths per 100,000 population) The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years).Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age);- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years). Mortality resulting from exposure to air pollution The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes.NANA Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking).This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking).Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the following formula:PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi) where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the model are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013). The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010 (Burnett et al, 2014) and further updated for the GBD 2013 study (Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used.The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of 1 ug/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 5.6 and 8.8 ug/m3, as described elsewhere (Ezzati et al, 2002; Lim et al, 2012). The country population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer were calculated using the following formula :PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative risk.The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a). An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors. As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene.Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries.

'Improved' sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Population with a basic handwashing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household. Improved sanitation facilities Improved sanitation facilities include the following: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Safely disposed in situ When pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied, the excreta may still remain isolated from human contact and can be considered safely managed. For example, with the new SDG indicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a common practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services. Treated offsite Not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment site. For instance, a portion may leak from the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. Similarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to open ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once the excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment equipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of SDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will initially be assessed based on the reported level of treatment. Method of computation: Household surveys and censuses provide data on use of types of basic sanitation facilities listed above, as well as the presence of handwashing materials in the home. The percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services is calculated by combining data on the proportion of the population using different types of basic sanitation facilities with estimates of the proportion of faecal waste which is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. The JMP estimates use of basic sanitation facilities for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression model to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of 'improved sanitation' facilities for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available.The JMP 2017 update and SDG baselines report describes in more detail how estimates of the proportion of household wastewater that is safely disposed of in situ or treated off-site have been combined with data on use of different types of sanitation facilities, as recorded in the JMP global database. A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. Data on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017.Presence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. Data were available for 70 countries in 2017. MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to 'basic sanitation'. The JMP developed the metric of use of 'improved' sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards.The above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or the transport and treatment of wastes at a designated treatment site. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment).Handwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In 2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that the most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household surveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the presence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether households have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by survey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing behaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour. Data sources:Access to water and sanitation are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, and key determinants of child survival, maternal, and children's health, family wellbeing, and economic productivity. Drinking water and sanitation facilities are also used in constructing wealth quintiles used by many integrated household surveys to analyse inequalities between rich and poor. Access to sanitation is therefore a core indicator for most household surveys. Currently the JMP database holds over 1,700 surveys and censuses. In high-income countries where household surveys or censuses do not always collect information on basic access, data are drawn from administrative records.Estimates of excreta management will be collected from countries and used to adjust the data on use of basic sanitation facilities as needed. Administrative, population and environmental data can also be combined to estimate safe disposal or transport of excreta, when no country data are available. Data on disposal or treatment of excreta are limited but estimates for safe management of faecal wastes can be calculated based on faecal waste flows associated with the use of different types of basic sanitation facility.Since the handwashing with soap survey questions were standardized in 2009, over 70 DHS and MICS surveys have included the module. JMP published handwashing estimates for 12 countries in its 2014 update, for 54 countries in its 2015 update, and for 70 countries in its 2017 update.The population data used by JMP, including the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas, are those established by the UN Population Division.Collection process:WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and territories. Before publishing, all JMP estimates undergo rigorous country consultations facilitated by WHO and UNICEF country offices. Often these consultations give rise to in-country visits, and meetings about data on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services and the monitoring systems that collect these data. The JMP has been engaged with more than fifty countries over the last 10 years in explaining JMP estimates, and reasons for discrepancies if any. Indicator release: 2020.Q4.G.02 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 6 goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) refers to 'all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons' (World Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation: An interagency statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4)NANA Number of girls and women aged 15-49 who have undergone FGM/C divided by the total number of girls and women aged 15-49 in the population multiplied by 100 There are existing tools and mechanisms for data collection that countries have implemented to monitor the situation with regards to this indicator. The modules used to collect information on the circumcision status of girls aged 0-14 and women aged 15-49 in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized. FGM/C is a violation of girls' and women's human rights. There is a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of FGM/C over both the short and long term. The practice of FGM/C is a direct manifestation of gender inequality FGM/C is condemned by a number of international treaties and conventions. Since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C. Data sources:Household surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since the late 1980s. In some countries, such data are also collected through other national household surveys.Collection process:UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).	As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why.

"SDG_SH_TRP_INTVN","Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases (number)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases (number) Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO. Treatment and care Treatment and care is broadly defined to allow for preventive, curative, surgical or rehabilitative treatment and care. In particular, it includes both:      1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as preventive chemotherapy (PC) for at least one PC-NTD; and      2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs.            Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.NANA Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an agreed international standard. [http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1]            1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC for at least one PC-NTD (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma). People may require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced.            2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available.            Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach. Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may be required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years. The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is the number that is expected to decrease toward 'the end of NTDs' by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.            This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention - that is, treatment and care for NTDs. Data sources: The number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is measured by existing country systems, and reported through joint request and reporting forms for donated medicines, the integrated NTD database, and other reports to WHO.      http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/preventive_chemotherapy/reporting/en/      http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/data/ntddatabase/en/             Country data are published via the WHO Global Health Observatory and Preventive Chemotherapy Data Portal.            http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/en/      http://apps.who.int/gho/cabinet/pc.jsp            Collection process: NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy (PC-NTDs)      As part of global efforts to accelerate expansion of preventive chemotherapy for elimination and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), WHO facilitates the supply of the following medicines donated by the pharmaceutical industry: diethylcarbamazine citrate, albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel. WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes.            A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the process of application, review and reporting as well as to improve coordination and integration among different programmes.            Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) - designed to assist countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which medicines are requested.            Joint Reporting Form (JRF) - designed to assist countries in reporting annual progress on integrated and coordinated distribution of medicines across PC-NTDs in the reporting year in a standardized format.            PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) - designed to standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis. National authorities are encouraged to complete this form and submit it to WHO on a yearly basis, together with the JRF.            The reports generated in the JRSM and in the JRF (SUMMARY worksheets) must be printed and signed by the NTD coordinator or a Ministry of Health representative to formally endorse the country's request for these medicines and the reported annual progress of the national programme(s). The date of signature must also be included. Once signatures have been obtained, the scanned copies of the two worksheets, together with the full Excel versions of the JRSM, the JRF and the EPIRF can be jointly submitted to WHO.

ASPIRE is an ongoing project that aims to improve SPL data quality, comparability and availability to better inform SPL policies and programs.NANA Data are calculated from national representative household surveys using ASPIRE: The Atlas of Social Protection - Indicators of Resilience and Equity, The World Bank (see datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/).         Coverage = Number of beneficiaries in the total population (or group) / Total population (or group).         Generally, ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original household survey data (with no imputations) and on a unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge and in depth country analysis relying on different data sources (administrative program level data). Household surveys have limitations. It is important to note that the extent to which information on specific transfers and programs is captured in the household surveys can vary a lot across countries. Often household surveys do not capture the universe of social protection and labor (SPL) programs in the country, in best practice cases just the largest programs. Many household surveys have limited information on SPL programs, some surveys collect information only on participation without including the transfer amounts; and others include program information mixed with private transfers, making it difficult to isolate individual SPL programs.         Therefore information on country SPL programs included in ASPIRE is limited to what is captured in the respective national household survey and does not necessarily represent the universe of programs existing in the country. In addition, the availability of ASPIRE indicators depends on the type of questions included in the survey. If transfer amounts are available, for example, adequacy and impact on poverty indicators can be generated. If only program participation questions are included in the survey, only non-monetary indicators can be generated such as coverage or beneficiary incidence.         As a consequence, ASPIRE performance indicators are not fully comparable across harmonized program categories and countries.         However, household surveys have the unique advantages of allowing analysis of program impact on household welfare. With such caveats in mind, ASPIRE indicators based on household surveys provide an approximate measure of social protection systems performance. ASPIRE coverage indicators refer to the 'effective' coverage definition, measuring the direct and indirect beneficiaries who are actually receiving social protection benefits at the time nationally representative household survey data are collected, as within a target group (total population, for different income quintiles, total population in urban and rural areas). 'Effective' coverage is directly relevant to SDG 1 of ending poverty in all its forms. ASPIRE indicators do not include (in the current edition) those who are protected by law, or those who have benefits guaranteed but are not necessarily receiving them at the time the survey is administered - for example people who actively contribute to old age pensions and are entitled to the benefits on reaching retirement age.

Employment  Poverty Line  Working poor  Working poverty rate= (Employed persons living on less than US$ 1.90 a day / Total employment) x 100 At the country level, comparisons over time may be affected by such factors as changes in survey types or data collection methods. The use of PPPs rather than market exchange rates ensures that differences in price levels across countries are taken into account. However, it cannot be categorically asserted that two people in two different countries, living below US$1.90 a day at PPP, face the same degree of deprivation or have the same degree of need.         Poverty in the context of this indicator is a concept that is applied to households, and not to individuals, based on the assumption that households pool their income. This assumption may not always be true.         Moreover, the poverty status of a household is a function of the wage and other employment-related income secured by those household members in employment, income derived from asset ownership, plus any other available income such as transfer payments and the number of household members. Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his or her own income, the income of other household members and the number of household members who need to be supported. It is thus often valuable to study household structure in relation to working poverty. In order to eradicate poverty, we must understand the root causes of poverty. The working poverty rate reveals the proportion of the employed population living in poverty despite being employed, implying that their employment-related incomes are not sufficient to lift them and their families out of poverty and ensure decent living conditions. The adequacy of earnings is a fundamental aspect of job quality, and these deficits in job quality could be keeping workers and their families in poverty. The proportion of working poor in total employment (that is, the working poverty rate) combines data on household income or consumption with labour force framework variables measured at the individual level and sheds light on the relationship between employment and household poverty. Data sources: The preferred data source is a household survey with variables that can reliably identify both the poverty status of households and the economic activity of the household's members. Examples include household income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys (LSMS) with employment modules, or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect information on household income. Such surveys offer the benefit of allowing the employment status and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same observation period.         Employment estimates derived from a household survey other than a labour force survey may, however, not be the most robust due to questionnaire design. Similarly, a labour force survey may not be the best instrument for collecting household income or consumption expenditure data, although an attached income module can be designed to achieve statistically reliable results, including ensuring an overlap in the observation period between household income (or consumption expenditure) and employment status.         Another possibility is to combine data from a household income and expenditure survey and from a separate labour force survey when the respondent households can be matched and consistency in the long observation period between the surveys can be obtained.

The rural poverty rate is the percentage of the rural population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, rural poverty line is used, the rural poverty line). Urban poverty rate is the percentage of the urban population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, urban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line). Poverty In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty according to national definitions, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the cost of living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Some countries may have separate urban and rural poverty lines to represent different purchasing powers.NANA Consumption or income data are gathered from nationally representative household surveys, which contain detailed responses to questions regarding spending habits and sources of income. Consumption, including consumption from own production, or income is calculated for the entire household. In some cases, an 'effective' household size is calculated from the actual household size to reflect assumed efficiencies in consumption; adjustments may also be made to reflect the number of children in a household. The number of people in those households is aggregated to estimate the number of poor persons.      National poverty rates use a country specific poverty line, reflecting the country's economic and social circumstances. In some case, the national poverty line is adjusted for different areas (such as urban and rural) within the country, to account for differences in prices or the availability of goods and services. Typically the urban poverty line is set higher than the rural poverty line; reflecting the relatively higher costs of living in urban areas. National poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. Caveats and limitations inherent to survey data applying to the construction of indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well.         To be useful for poverty estimates, surveys must be nationally representative. They must also include enough information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household consumption or income (including consumption or income from own production) and to construct a correctly weighted distribution of consumption or income per person.        Consumption is the preferred welfare indicator for a number of reasons1. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately. For example, the poor who work in the informal sector may not receive or report monetary wages; self-employed workers often experience irregular income flows; and many people in rural areas depend on idiosyncratic, agricultural incomes. Moreover, consumption accords better with the idea of the standard of living than income, which can vary over time even if the actual standard of living does not. Thus, whenever possible, consumption-based welfare indicators are used to estimate the poverty measures reported here. But consumption data are not always available. For instance in Latin America and the Caribbean, the vast majority of countries collect primarily income data. In those cases there is little choice but to use income data.        Consumption is measured by using household survey questions on food and nonfood expenditures as well as food consumed from the household's own production, which is particularly important in the poorest developing countries. This information is collected either through recall questions using lists of consumption items or through diaries in which respondents record all expenditures daily. But these methods do not always provide equivalent information, and depending on the approach used, consumption can be underestimated or overestimated. Different surveys use different recall or reference periods. Depending on the true flow of expenditures, the rate of spending reported is sensitive to the length of reporting period. The longer the reference period, the more likely respondents will fail to recall certain expensesâ<U+0080><U+0094>especially food itemsâ<U+0080><U+0094>thus resulting in underestimation of true expenditure.        Best-practice surveys administer detailed lists of specific consumption items. These individual items collected through the questionnaires are aggregated afterwards. But many surveys use questionnaires in which respondents are asked to report expenditures for broad categories of goods. In other words, specific consumption items are implicitly aggregated by virtue of the questionnaire design. This shortens the interview, reducing the cost of the survey. A shorter questionnaire is also thought to reduce the likelihood of fatigue for both respondents and interviewers, which can lead to reporting errors. However, there is also evidence that less detailed coverage of specific items in the questionnaire can lead to underestimation of actual household consumption. The reuse of questionnaires may cause new consumption goods to be omitted, leading to further underreporting.        Invariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home. This is often referred to as 'unit nonresponse' and is distinct from 'item nonresponse,' which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to consumption or income. To the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes are not equally likely to respond. Relatively rich households may be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their time or because of concerns about intrusion in their affairs. It is conceivable that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are homeless and hard to reach in standard household survey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less easily interviewed. If nonresponse systematically increases with income, surveys will tend to overestimate poverty. But if compliance tends to be lower for both the very poor and the very rich, there will be potentially offsetting effects on the measured incidence of poverty.        Even if survey data were entirely accurate and comprehensive, the measure of poverty obtained could still fail to capture important aspects of individual welfare. For example, using household consumption measures ignores potential inequalities within households. Thus, consumption- or income-based poverty measures are informative but should not be interpreted as a sufficient statistic for assessing the quality of people's lives. The national poverty rate, a 'headcount' measure, is one of the most commonly calculated measures of poverty. Yet it has the drawback that it does not capture income inequality among the poor or the depth of poverty. For instance, it fails to account for the fact that some people may be living just below the poverty line, while others experience far greater shortfalls. Policymakers seeking to make the largest possible impact on the headcount measure might be tempted to direct their poverty alleviation resources to those closest to the poverty line (and therefore least poor).        Issues may also arise when comparing poverty measures within countries when urban and rural poverty lines represent different purchasing powers. For example, the cost of living is typically higher in urban than in rural areas. One reason is that food staples tend to be more expensive in urban areas. So the urban monetary poverty line should be higher than the rural poverty line. But it is not always clear that the difference between urban and rural poverty lines found in practice reflects only differences in the cost of living. In some countries the urban poverty line in common use has a higher real valueâ<U+0080><U+0094>meaning that it allows the purchase of more commodities for consumptionâ<U+0080><U+0094>than does the rural poverty line. Sometimes the difference has been so large as to imply that the incidence of poverty is greater in urban than in rural areas, even though the reverse is found when adjustments are made only for differences in the cost of living. As with international comparisons, when the real value of the poverty line varies it is not clear how meaningful such urban-rural comparisons are.        Lastly, these income/consumption based poverty indicators do not fully reflect the other dimensions of poverty such as inequality, vulnerability, and lack of voice and power of the poor. Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates. Data sources: National poverty estimates are typically produced and owned by country governments (e.g., National Statistic Office), and sometimes with technical assistance from the World Bank and UNDP. Upon release of the national poverty estimates by the government, the Global Poverty Working Group of the World Bank assesses the methodology used by the government, validates the estimates with raw data whenever possible, and consults the country economists for publishing. Accepted estimates, along with metadata, will be published in the WDI database as well as the Poverty and Equity Database of the World Bank.      Another source is World Bank's Poverty Assessments. The World Bank periodically prepares poverty assessments of countries in which it has an active program, in close collaboration with national institutions, other development agencies, and civil society groups, including poor people's organizations. Poverty assessments report the extent and causes of poverty and propose strategies to reduce it. The poverty assessments are the best available source of information on poverty estimates using national poverty lines. They often include separate assessments of urban and rural poverty.

Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'. Unpaid domestic and care work Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'. Productive activity An activity is said to be productive or to fall within the 'general production boundary' if it satisfies the third-person criterion (the activity can be delegated to another person and yield the same desired results).Productive activities can be further classified based on the ILO framework for work statistics (included in the 19th ICLS resolution) into:a)	Own-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)b)	Employment (activities to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit)c)	Unpaid trainee work (any unpaid activity to produce goods or provide services for others, in order to acquire workplace experience or skills in a trade or profession)d)	Volunteer work (any unpaid, non-compulsory activity to produce goods or provide services for others)e)	Other forms of workThe own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.Indicator 5.4.1 only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions '3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members' and '4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members'.As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017.NA Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day. Weekly data is averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated by dividing the daily average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work by 24 hours. Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated as:Indicator 5.4.1 = ((daily number of hours spent on domestic work + daily number of hours spent on core work) / 24) * 100If data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain daily time spent.Average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. SDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both. Time use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of individuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including unpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender equality.International comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including: a)	Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity.  b)	Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. c)	Time-use data presented refer to the 'main activity' only. Any 'secondary activity' performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. d)	Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.  Data sources:Most data on time use are collected through dedicated time use surveys or from time-use modules integrated in multi-purpose household surveys, conducted at national level.Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection.Collection process:The official counterparts at the country level are the national statistical offices.

It is a measure of the personal likelihood or risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury for each worker in the reference group.The number of occupational injuries expressed per a given number of workers in the reference group is also known as the incidence rate of occupational injuries. Occupational accident An unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer. Occupational injury Any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. An occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-fatal injuries could entail the loss of work days). Fatal occupational injury An occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident. The incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be calculated separately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a different source than those on non-fatal injuries, which would make their sum into total occupational accidents inaccurate.The fatal occupational injury incidence rate is expressed per 100,000 workers in the reference group, and thus, is calculated as follows:  Fatal occupational injury incidence rate = (New cases of fatal injury during the reference year / Workers in the reference group during the reference year) * 100,000Similarly, the non-fatal occupational injury incidence rate is calculated as follows:  Non fatal occupational injury incidence rate = (New cases of non fatal injury during the reference year / Workers in the reference group during the reference year) * 100,000In calculating the average number of workers, the number of part-time workers should be converted to full-time equivalents. For the calculation of rates, the numerator and the denominator should have the same coverage. For example, if self-employed persons are not covered by the source of statistics on fatal occupational injuries, they should also be taken out of the denominator. There may be problems of under reporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in place to ensure the best reporting and data quality. Under reporting is thought to be present in countries at all levels of development, but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data users should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. Double-counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several registries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive statistics.Because data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather than levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in occupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator is volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or national calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed. This indicator provides valuable information that could be used to formulate policies and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries, diseases and deaths. It could also be used to monitor the implementation of these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular occupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide information for prevention purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations and economic activities with the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety and reveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers’ organizations, workers and workers’ organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers, employers’ organizations, workers and workers’ organizations to introduce accident prevention measures. Data sources:The recommended data sources are different types of administrative records, such as records of national systems for the notification of occupational injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; insurance and compensation records, death registers), supplemented by household surveys (especially in order to cover informal sector enterprises and the self-employed) and/or establishment surveys.The metadata should clearly specify (i) whether the statistics relate to cases of occupational injury which have been reported (to an accident notification system or to an accident compensation scheme), compensated (by an accident insurance scheme) or identified in some other way (for example through a survey of households or establishments) and (ii) whether cases of occupational disease and cases of injury due to commuting accidents are excluded from the statistics, as recommended.Collection process:The ILO sends out its annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators.

Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period. Employment All persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. Real GDP per employed person = GDP at constant prices / Total employment        The numerator and denominator of the equation above should refer to the same reference period, for example, the same calendar year.If we call the real GDP per employed person 'LabProd', then the annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person is calculated as follows:Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person = (((LabProd in year n)  - (LabProd in year n-1)) / (LabProd in year n-1)) x 100 Output measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy. However, despite common principles that are mostly based on the United Nations System of National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international consistency of national accounts estimates, based on factors such as differences in the treatment of output in services sectors, differences in methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, the use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the degree of coverage of informal economic activities.Data on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as much as possible, to the average number of persons with one or more paid jobs during the year. That is, the reliability of the employment data is also dependent on the degree of coverage of informal activities by the statistical source used. Real GDP per employed person being a measure of labour productivity, this indicator represents a measure of labour productivity growth, thus providing information on the evolution, efficiency and quality of human capital in the production process.Economic growth in a country can be ascribed to many factors, including increased employment and more effective work by those who are employed. This indicator casts light on the latter effect, therefore being a key measure of economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They can also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance affects living standards. Data sources:Output measures used in the numerator of this indicator (Gross Domestic Product) are best obtained from the production side of national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy (adjusted for inflation, in constant prices).Employment data used in the denominator are preferably derived from labour force or other household surveys with an employment module. In the absence of a household survey, establishment surveys, administrative records or official estimates based on reliable sources can be used as well as population censuses. It is however important to note that employment data from establishment surveys will capture the number of jobs and not the number of persons employed as preferred for the denominator. Also, establishment surveys cover, in many cases, the formal sector and employers and employees only, not accounting for the whole economy.When calculating this indicator, it is important to ensure that the coverage of the employment data is consistent with that of the national accounts.Collection process:For the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, the ILO uses country-level estimates of GDP in constant 2010 US$ from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database and country-level estimates on employment from household surveys or derived from the ILO's TEM to calculate levels and growth rates of labour productivity at the country, regional and global levels.

"SDG_SL_TLF_NEET","Proportion of youth not in education, employment or training, by sex and age (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of youth not in education, employment or training, by sex and age (%) This indicator conveys the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training (also known as 'the youth NEET rate'). Youth For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons between the ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive). According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. Employment Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. Youth NEET rate = (Youth - (Youth in employment + Youth not in employment but in education or training) / Youth ) * 100        It is important to note here that youth simultaneously in employment and education or training should not be double counted when subtracted from the total number of youth. The formula can also be expressed as:Youth NEET rate = ((Unemployed youth + Youth outside the labour force) - (Unempluyed youth in education or training + Youth outside the labour force)) / Youth ) * 100 The calculation of this indicator requires to have reliable information on both the labour market status and the participation in education or training of young persons. The quality of such information is heavily dependent on the questionnaire design, the sample size and design and the accuracy of respondents' answers. In terms of the analysis of the indicator, in order to avoid misinterpreting it, it is important to bear in mind that it is composed of two different sub-groups (unemployed youth not in education or training and youth outside the labour force not in education or training). The prevalence and composition of each sub-group would have policy implications, and thus should also be considered when analysing the NEET rate. The share of youth not in employment, education or training (youth NEET rate) provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. It includes discouraged worker youth as well as those who are outside the labour force due to disability or engagement in household chores, among other reasons. Youth NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of potential youth labour market entrants as compared with the youth inactivity rate, as the latter includes those youth who are outside the labour force and are in education, and thus are furthering their skills and qualifications. Data sources:The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household survey with an appropriate employment module may be used to obtain the required data. Collection process:The ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators. Indicator 8.6.1 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and national statistical offices or through the processing of microdata sets of national labour force surveys.

Adolescent birth rate The adolescent birth rate represents the risk of childbearing among females in the particular age group. The adolescent birth rate among women aged 15-19 years is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.NANA The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data.In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.In the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observationyear corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under- registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census.If data are available, adolescent fertility at ages 10-14 years can also be computed.For a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of Fertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11, ( https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/handbooks/Handbook_Fertility_Mortality.pdf). Indirect methods of estimation are analyzed in Manual X: Indirect Techniques for Demographic Estimation, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.83.XIII.2. (https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/mortality/Manual_X.pdf). Discrepancies between the sources of data at the country level are common and the level of the adolescent birth rate depends in part on the source of the data selected.For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive but die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may suffer from limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage.For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling variability in the case of surveys.With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20-24 years.The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates. It has also been called adolescent fertility rate. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19. Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential for improving sexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman's life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socio-economic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services. Data sources:Civil registration is the preferred data source. Census and household survey are alternate sources when there is no reliable civil registration. Data on births by age of mother are obtained from civil registration systems covering 90 per cent or more of all live births, supplemented eventually by census or survey estimates for periods when registration data are not available. For the numerator, the figures reported by National Statistical Offices to theUnited Nations Statistics Division have first priority. When they are not available or present problems, use is made of data from the regional statistical units or directly from National Statistical Offices. For the denominator, first priority is given to the latest revision of World Population Prospects produced by the Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations. In cases where the numerator does not cover the complete de facto population, an alternative appropriate population estimate is used if available. When either the numerator or denominator is missing, the direct estimate of the rate produced by the National Statistics Office is used. Information on sources is provided at the cell level. When the numerator and denominator come from two different sources, they are listed in that order.In countries lacking a civil registration system or where the coverage of that system is lower than 90 per cent of all live births, the adolescent birth rate is obtained from household survey data and census data. Registration data regarded as less than 90 per cent complete are exceptionally used for countries where the alternative sources present problems of compatibility and registration data can provide an assessment of trends. In countries with multiple survey programmes, large sample surveys conducted on an annual or biennial basis are given precedence when they exist.For information on the source of each estimate, see United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2019).

Whenever the estimates are available in the survey report, they are directly taken from it. If clarification is needed, contact is made with the survey sponsors or authoring organization, which occasionally may supply corrected or adjusted estimates in response. In other cases, if microdata are available, estimates are produced by the Population Division based on national data. For census data, the estimates are preferably directly obtained from census reports. In such cases, adjusted rates are only used when reported by the National Statistical Office. In other cases, the adolescent birth rate is computed from tables on births in the preceding 12 months by age of mother, and census population distribution by sex and age.In addition to obtaining data and estimates directly from the websites of National Statistical Offices, the following databases and websites are utilized: the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) ( http://api.dhsprogram.com/#/index.html), Demographic Yearbook database of the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (http://data.un.org/), internal databases of the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (see latest public release here: https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/fertility/wfd2019.asp).

The modules used to collect information on marital status among women and men of reproductive age (15-49 years) in the DHS and MICS have been fully harmonized. Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. Child marriage often compromises a girl's development by resulting in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased risk of intimate partner violence. In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights - such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices.

"SDG_AG_FPA_COMM","Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (IFPA), by type of product","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (IFPA), by type of product The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period. Food price anomalies (IFPA) The indicator of price anomalies (IFPA) relies on two compound growth rates (CGR's), a quarterly compound growth rate (CQGR) and an annual compound growth rate (CAGR). A CGR is a geometric mean that assumes that a random variable grows at a steady rate, compounded over a specific period of time.               Because it assumes a steady rate of growth the CGR smoothes the effect of volatility of price changes. The CGR is the growth in any random variable from time period tA and tB, raised to the power of one over the length of the period of time being considered. NANA Mathematically the IFPA for a particular year y in month t is calculated as the weighted sum of the quarterly indicator of food price anomalies (QIFPAyt) and the annual indicator of food price anomalies (AIFPAyt). It is appropriate to caution the reader that the indicator is just a guide to understanding market dynamics. As such, one cannot rely on it as the sole element to determine whether a food price in a particular market at a given time is abnormally high or low due to the direct effects of local policies. Results must be weighed with other available information on market fundamentals, macroeconomic context and external shocks. The main challenge in implementing the indicator is data availability and data quality. The calculation of the indicator requires an uninterrupted monthly price series (i.e. if more than 3 consecutive months of data are missing the series may be dropped) of at least 5 years, which include the year being analysed and the 4 preceding years to generate averages and standard deviations. Finally, the indicator is calculated on real price terms to net out the effects of inflation and compare prices in constant money terms over time. However, if food items' contribution to CPI is high, it induces downward bias in food real price - i.e., it underestimates the extent of the price increase (nominal prices or a non-food CPI could be used). The thresholds for the IFPAy are expressed as the normalized difference of the compound growth rate of prices from their historical mean for the predefined period of time. And three ranges are established: 1) a less than half a standard deviation difference from the mean is considered normal; 2) a difference that is half but less than one standard deviation is considered moderately high; 3) a difference from the historical mean that is at least one standard deviation greater than the mean is considered abnormally high.        0.5 =< IFPAy < 1 Moderately high        IFPAy >= 1 Abnormally high        -0.5 =< IFPAy < 0.5 Normal        We use one standard deviation as the relevant threshold since we want to minimize the probability of missing a significant market event. Events that deviate by more than one standard deviation from their historical distribution have a low probability of occurring and thus are easier to identify as abnormally high prices. Data Sources:        FAO relies on official domestic price data that it compiles in the Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) tool to calculate and monitor the indicator. Five cereal products will be monitored: maize & maize products, wheat & wheat flour, rice, sorghum and millet. While diets across the world have become more diversified with increasing incomes, cereals still account for 45 percent of a person's daily caloric intake, making this commodity group the most important in terms of its contribution to caloric intake, particularly for low income populations (FAOSTAT, 2017). For the purpose of a more comprehensive coverage at the global level, FAO also calculates IFPA on countries' officially reported food price indices as reported in FAOSTAT, which facilitates cross country comparisons as it uses a national level food basket covering all the most important commodities consumed. While the basket differs from country to country, this approach is more reflective of national and global trends as countries have predefined the commodities that have the most impact on local consumers. This approach also facilitates the implementation of the indicator as countries will not be asked to create a new index or modify existing methodologies.            For the Food CPI, the FAOSTAT monthly CPI & Food CPI database was based on the ILO CPI data until December 2014. In 2014, IMF-ILO-FAO agreed to transfer global CPI data compilation from ILO to IMF. Upon agreement, CPIs for all items and its sub components originates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Statistics Division(UNSD) for countries not covered by the IMF. However, due to a limited time coverage from IMF and UNSD for a number of countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European statistics (EUROSTAT), the Latin America and the Caribbean statistics (CEPALSTAT), Central Bank of Western African States (BCEAO), Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and national statistical office website data are used for missing historical data from IMF and UNSD food CPI.  The FAO CPI dataset for all items (or general CPI) and the Food CPI, consists of a complete and consistent set of time series from January 2000 onwards.  It further contains regional and global food CPIs compiled by FAO using population weights to aggregate across countries.

The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014. Food insecurity Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the inability to access food results in a series of experiences and conditions that are fairly common across cultures and socio-economic contexts and that range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to the need to compromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being forced to reduce the intake of food by cutting portion sizes or skipping meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not having means to access any food for a whole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis of an experience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods rooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute theoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. The severity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this indicator thus directly reflects the extent of households' or individuals' inability to regularly access the food they need.NANA Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity. The data is analysed using the Rasch model (also known as one-parameter logistic model, 1-PL), which postulates that the probability of observing an affirmative answer by respondent i to question j, is a logistic function of the distance, on an underlying scale of severity, between the position of the respondent, ai, and that of the item, bj.                Parameters ai and bj can be estimated using maximum likelihood procedures. Parameters ai, in particular, are interpreted as a measure of the severity of the food security condition for each respondent and are used to classify them into classes of food insecurity.                The FIES considers the three classes of (a) food security or mild food insecurity; b) moderate or severe food insecurity, and (c) severe food insecurity, and estimates the probability of being moderately or severely food insecure (Pmod+sev) and the probability of being severely food insecure (Psev) for each respondent, with 0 < Psev < Pmod+sev < 1. The probability of being food secure or mildly food insecure can be obtained as Pfs = 1 - Pmod+sev.                Given a representative sample, the prevalence of food insecurity at moderate or severe levels (FImod+sev), and at severe levels (FIsev) in the population are computed as the weighted sum of the probability of belonging to the moderate or severe food insecurity class, and to the severe food insecurity class, respectively, of all individual or household respondents in a sample.

When used in the Gallup World Poll, with sample sizes of only about 1000 individuals, the width of confidence intervals rarely exceeds 20% of the measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of around 50% are estimated with margins of errors of plus or minus 5%). Obviously, confidence intervals are likely to be much smaller when national prevalence rates are estimated using larger samples.            Compared to other proposed non-official indicators of household food insecurity, the FIES based approach has the advantage that food insecurity prevalence rates are directly comparable across population groups and countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe' food insecurity) other approaches have yet to demonstrate the formal comparability of the thresholds used for classification, due to lack of the definition of a proper statistical model that links the values of the 'indexes' or 'scores' used for classification, to the severity of food insecurity.  For this reason, care should be taken when comparing the results obtained with the FIES with those obtained with these other indicators, even if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to describe them. Food insecurity at moderate levels of severity is typically associated with the inability to regularly eat healthy, balanced diets. As such, high prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered a predictor of various forms of diet-related health conditions in the population, associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. Severe levels of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high probability of reduced food intake and therefore can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition, including hunger.            Short questionnaires like the FIES are very easy to administer at limited cost, which is one of the main advantages of their use. The ability to precisely determine the food insecurity status of specific individuals or households, however, is limited by the small number of questions, a reason why assignment of individual respondents to food insecurity classes is best done in probability terms, thus ensuring that estimates of prevalence rates in a population are sufficiently reliable even when based on relatively small sample sizes.             As with any statistical assessment, reliability and precision crucially depend on the quality of the survey design and implementation. One major advantage of the analytic treatment of the data through the Rasch model based methods is that it permits testing the quality of the data collected and evaluating the likely margin of uncertainty around estimated prevalence rates, which should always be reported. Data can be collected using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey module (FIES-SM) developed by FAO, or any other experience-based food security scale questionnaires, including:      -	the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) developed by the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture, and used in the US and Canada,       -	the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (or Escala Latinoamericana y CaribeÃ±a de Seguridad Alimentaria - ELCSA), used in Guatemala and tested in several other Spanish speaking countries in Latin America,        -	the Mexican Food Security Scale (or Escala Mexicana de Seguridad Alimentaria, - EMSA), an adaptation of the ELCSA used in Mexico,       -	the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (Escala Brasileira de medida de la InseguranÃ§a Alimentar - EBIA) used in Brazil, or       -	the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS),       or any adaptation of the above that can be calibrated against the global FIES.            Two versions of the FIES-SM are available for use in surveys of individuals or households respectively, and the difference stands in whether respondents are asked to report only on their individual experiences, or also on that of other member of the household.      The questions should be adapted and administered in the respondents' preferred language and enumerators instructed to make sure that respondents recognize the reference period and the qualifier according to which experiences should be reported only when due to 'lack of money or other resources' and not, for example, for reasons related to health or other cultural habits (such as fasting for religious credos).            The FIES-SM can be included in virtually any telephone-based or personal interview based survey of the population, though face to face interview is preferred.             Since 2014, the individual referenced FIES-SM is applied to nationally representative samples of the population aged 15 or more in all countries covered by the Gallup World Poll (more than 140 countries every year, covering 90% of the world population).

The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014. Food insecurity Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the inability to access food results in a series of experiences and conditions that are fairly common across cultures and socio-economic contexts and that range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to the need to compromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being forced to reduce the intake of food by cutting portion sizes or skipping meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not having means to access any food for a whole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis of an experience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods rooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute theoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. The severity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this indicator thus directly reflects the extent of households' or individuals' inability to regularly access the food they need.NANA Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity. The data is analysed using the Rasch model (also known as one-parameter logistic model, 1-PL), which postulates that the probability of observing an affirmative answer by respondent i to question j, is a logistic function of the distance, on an underlying scale of severity, between the position of the respondent, ai, and that of the item, bj.                Parameters ai and bj can be estimated using maximum likelihood procedures. Parameters ai, in particular, are interpreted as a measure of the severity of the food security condition for each respondent and are used to classify them into classes of food insecurity.                The FIES considers the three classes of (a) food security or mild food insecurity; b) moderate or severe food insecurity, and (c) severe food insecurity, and estimates the probability of being moderately or severely food insecure (Pmod+sev) and the probability of being severely food insecure (Psev) for each respondent, with 0 < Psev < Pmod+sev < 1. The probability of being food secure or mildly food insecure can be obtained as Pfs = 1 - Pmod+sev.                Given a representative sample, the prevalence of food insecurity at moderate or severe levels (FImod+sev), and at severe levels (FIsev) in the population are computed as the weighted sum of the probability of belonging to the moderate or severe food insecurity class, and to the severe food insecurity class, respectively, of all individual or household respondents in a sample.

The indicator is expressed as a percentage. Computer-related activities Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills are as follows:- Copying or moving a file or folder- Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a document- Sending e-mails with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video)- Using basic arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheet- Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer)- Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software- Creating electronic presentations with presentation software (including images, sound, video or charts)- Transferring files between a computer and other devices- Writing a computer program using a specialized programming languageA computer refers to a desktop computer, a laptop (portable) computer or a tablet (or similar handheld computer). It does not include equipment with some embedded computing abilities, such as smart TV sets, and devices with telephony as their primary function, such as smartphones.Most individuals will have carried out more than one activity and therefore multiple responses are expected. The tasks are broadly ordered from less complex to more complex, although there is no requirement for a respondent to select simpler tasks before selecting a more complex task. A decision was made in 2018 to modify the formulation of this indicator (At the 6th Expert Group meeting on ICT Household Indicators (EGH), in Geneva), to make the indicator independent of the device used. This data will be collected from member states from 2020 onwards, and incorporate changes to some of the skills categories that were agreed in the 6th and 7th EGH meetings. The revised and new skills categories will be:- Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move data, information and content in digital environments (e.g. within a document, between devices, on the cloud)- Sending messages (e.g. e-mail, messaging service, SMS) with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video)- Using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet- Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer) through wired or wireless technologies- Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software and apps- Creating electronic presentations with presentation software (including text, images, sound, video or charts)- Transferring files or applications between devices (including via cloud-storage)- Setting up effective security measures (e.g. strong passwords, log-in attempt notification) to protect devices and online accounts - Changing privacy settings on your device, account or app to limit the sharing of personal data and information (e.g. name, contact information, photos)- Verifying the reliability of information found online- Programming or coding in digital environments (e.g. computer software, app development)NANA This indicator is calculated as the proportion of in-scope who have carried out each activity in the past 3 months, regardless of where that activity took place. The indicator is expressed as a percentage.Figures supplied are expressed as a proportion of the in-scope population. This indicator is relatively new but based on an internationally-agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of International Telecommunications Union (ITU), through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It was also endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2014 , and again in 2020.The indicator is based on the responses provided by interviewees regarding certain activities that they have carried out in a reference period of time. However, it is not a direct assessment of skills nor do we know if those activities were undertaken effectively. ICT skills determine the effective use of information and communication technology, so this indicator may therefore assist in making the link between ICT usage and impact. The lack of such skills continues to be one of the key barriers keeping people from fully benefitting from the potential of information and communication technologies. These data may be used to inform targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute to an inclusive information society.This is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (in 2014). Data sources: Countries can collect data on this indicator through national household surveys. Data for different countries are compiled by ITU.Collection process: Data for different countries are compiled and provided by ITU.

Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods. Probability of dying The likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate. Life table A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to a set of age-specific mortality rates. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator:            1. Estimation of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population Prospects 2012 revision.             2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions.             3. Calculation of age-specific mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between 30 and 70.             4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.            The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of data available from countries:      For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.            For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a modelling framework.            The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. The ICD codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99, Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98       Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of death, can be found on page 6 of this document:            NCD Global Monitoring Framework: Indicator Definitions and Specifications. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2014 (http://www.who.int/nmh/ncd-tools/indicators/GMF_Indicator_Definitions_FinalNOV2014.pdf?ua=1) Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death. Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population. Data sources: The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Other possible data sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, and sample or sentinel registration systems.      Collection process: WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its cause-of-death estimates.

"SDG_SH_STA_MORT","Maternal mortality ratio","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Maternal mortality ratio The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.      Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period. Maternal death The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes. Pregnancy-related death The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death. Late maternal death The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days, but less than one year after termination of pregnancy. The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.            The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Some countries undertake these adjustments or corrections as part of specialized/confidential enquiries or administrative efforts embedded within maternal mortality monitoring programmes.                Estimation and projection of maternal mortality indicators are undertaken using the BMat model. This model is intended to ensure that the MMR estimation approach is consistent across all countries but remains flexible in that it is based on covariate-driven trends to inform estimates in countries or country-periods with limited information; captures observed trends in countries with longer time series of observations; and takes into account the differences in stochastic and sampling errors across observations.                See more detailed information on methodology at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-01-01.pdf The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the combination of two factors:      i. The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.      ii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).            The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above.            By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in the population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15-49 years. All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2019 estimation round include a point-estimate and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). Data are available and can be downloaded from the webpage 'maternal mortality - levels and trends 2000-2017: http://mmr2017.srhr.org. Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates.            For example: The estimated 2017 global MMR is 211 (UI 199 to 243)      This means:      - The point-estimate is 211 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 199 to 243.      - There is a 50% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 211, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 211.      - There is an 80% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies between 199 and 243.      - There is still a 10% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 243, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 199.            Other accurate interpretations include:      - We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is at least 199.      - We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is 243 or less.            The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width of an indicator's UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an indicator's true value lies close to the point-estimate. Data sources: See page 14 of the report (https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal-mortality-2000-2017/en/).            Collection process:            The MMEIG maintains an input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration, population-based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys. This database is used to determine the number of maternal deaths and where possible the number of deaths among all women of reproductive age (WRA) to calculate the 'PM' proportion of maternal deaths among WRA. The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where 'D' is the number of deaths in women aged 15-49 (WRA) and 'B' is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects 2019.            Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country, regional, and global level estimates. The model's fit is assessed by cross-validation. Estimates are then reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process and SDG focal points. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB. 107.R8) seeking to 'establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions'. A key objective of this consultation process is 'to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used'. Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.            The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.            Adjustments are made according to the data source type:            (1) CRVS, for incompleteness and misclassification of maternal deaths            (2) reports providing 'pregnancy-related' mortality, for underreporting of these deaths, as well as over-reporting of maternal deaths due to inclusion of deaths which are accidental or incidental to pregnancy (thus outside of the definition of maternal mortality).             The analysis also accounts for stochastic errors due to the general rarity of maternal deaths, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error.

Global and regional estimates are based on methodology outlined in UNICEF-WHO-The World Bank: Joint child malnutrition estimates - Levels and trends (UNICEF/WHO/WB 2012 ) Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels. Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Child stunting refers to a child who is too short for his or her age and is the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition. Stunting is a contributing risk factor to child mortality and is also a marker of inequalities in human development. Stunted children fail to reach their physical and cognitive potential. Child stunting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators. Data sources: For the majority of countries, nationally representative household surveys constitute the data source.  For a limited number of countries data from surveillance systems is used if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%).    For both data sources, the child's height and weight measurements have to be collected following recommended standard measuring techniques (WHO 2008).             Collection process: UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group jointly review new data sources to update the country level estimates.  Each agency uses  their existing mechanisms for obtaining data.      For WHO, see published  database methodology (de Onis et al. 2004).  For UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working at national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely provide technical support for the collection and analysis of data. For the past 20 years UNICEF has undertaken an annual process to update its global databases, called Country Reporting on Indicators for Goals (CRING). This exercise is done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices with the purpose of ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally comparable data. UNICEF country offices are invited to submit, through an online system, nationally representative data for over 100 key indicators on the well-being of women and children, including stunting. The country office staff work with local counterparts to ensure the most relevant data are shared.  Updates sent by the country offices are then reviewed by sector specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data quality of the submitted estimates and re-analysis where possible. This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most reliable information is included in the databases. Once reviewed, feedback is made available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why.  UNICEF uses these data obtained through CRING to feed into the joint dataset. The World Bank Group provides estimates availabe through the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which ussually requires re-analysis of datasets given theat the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the stunting data.

Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease and information from death (vital) registration systems.            Estimates of incidence for each country are derived, using one or more of the following approaches depending on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition.            Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates.            Details are available from TB impact measurement: policy and recommendations for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control and from the online technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report 2017 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00278 Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that under-diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect estimates are based on notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and under-diagnosis.                TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values. Following two years of consultations, a new post-2015 global tuberculosis strategy was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2014. Known as the End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to 'End the global tuberculosis epidemic', and correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs.       The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-diagnosis of cases. Data sources: Details about data sources and methods are available in the following publicly available paper: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.00278.pdf            Collection process: National TB Programmes report every year between March and June their annual TB data to WHO using a standardized online data reporting system maintained at WHO. The system includes real-time checks for data consistency. Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and communicated with countries. In selected countries with new survey data, estimates are updated separately during the year. All estimates are communicated in August-September and revisions are done based on feedback. The final set of estimates is reviewed in WHO before publication in October, for compliance with specific international standards and harmonization of breakdowns for age and sex groups.

Earnings Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’ contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees’ gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.NANA Statistics on average hourly earnings by sex can be used to calculate the gender pay gap, as follows:Gender pay gap=  ([Average hourly earnings]_Men- [Average hourly earnings]_Women)/[Average hourly earnings]_Men   x 100 The variety of possible sources for statistics on earnings greatly hinders international comparability, as each type of source has its own coverage, scope and characteristics. It would not be fully accurate to compare, for example, hourly earnings from a labour force survey for one country with hourly earnings from an establishment survey for another. The use of non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied further hamper cross-country comparisons. Earnings are a key aspect of quality of employment and living conditions. Information on hourly earnings disaggregated by various classifications (sex, age, occupation, disability status) provides some indication of the extent to which pay equality is respected or achieved. Data sources: There are a variety of possible sources of data on employees’ earnings. Establishment surveys are usually the most reliable source, given the high accuracy of earnings figures derived from them (the information typically comes from the payroll, so is precise). However, the scope of these statistics is limited to the coverage of the establishment survey in question (usually excluding small establishments, agricultural establishments and/or informal sector establishments).Household surveys (and especially labour force surveys) can provide earnings statistics covering all economic activities, and all establishment types and sizes, but the quality of the data is highly dependent on the accuracy of respondents’ answers.Data on earnings could also be derived from a variety of administrative records.

"SDG_EN_H2O_OPAMBQ","Proportion of open water bodies with good ambient water quality (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of open water bodies with good ambient water quality (%) The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. Aquifer Geological formation capable of storing, transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of water. Classification of water quality If at least 80% of the monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a water body comply with their respective target values, the water body is classified as having a 'good' water quality status. Each water body is classified as being of 'good' or 'not good' status. Groundwater Subsurface water occupying the saturated zone. The indicator is computed by first classifying all assessed water bodies based on the compliance of the monitoring data collected for selected parameters at monitoring locations within the water body with parameter-specific target values:Cwq = (nc / nm) * 100Where  Cwq is the percentage compliance [%];  nc is the number of monitoring values in compliance with the target values;  nm is the total number of monitoring values.A threshold value of 80% compliance is defined to classify water bodies as 'good' quality. Thus, a body of water is classified as having a good quality status if at least 80% of all monitoring data from all monitoring stations within the water body are in compliance with the respective targets.In a second step, the classification results are used to compute the indicator as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having a good quality status to the total number of classified water bodies expressed in percentage:WBGQ = (ng / nt) * 100Where  WBGQ is the percentage of water bodies classified as having a good quality status;  ng is the number of classified water bodies classified as having a good quality status;  nc is the total number of monitored and classified water bodies. The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 6.3.2 requires considerable national financial and human capacities to regularly measure water quality parameters at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, and to consistently collect, quality-assure and process the monitoring data to compute the indicator. Substantial investments in monitoring and data management infrastructures, as well as targeted capacity development in water quality monitoring programme design and operation, will be required in many countries to enhance national capacities to regularly and consistently report on the indicator. Recognizing the differences in monitoring and data processing capacities among countries, the indicator methodology offers a progressive monitoring approach allowing countries to start with reporting based on their existing capacity and progressively enhance the data coverage and indicator significance with increasing capacity.Level 1 monitoring includes a set of general, easily measurable, physico-chemical water quality parameters that can indicate water quality degradation. They can be used to assess the quality status of water bodies, facilitating global comparability and maintaining a balance between the significance of the indicator and the monitoring requirements for each country. Level 2 monitoring allows countries with enhanced capacities to include additional water quality parameters, such as toxic substances and biological monitoring, as well as more sophisticated quality classification schemes to assess and report on the quality of their water bodies more accurately. Good ambient water quality is essential for protecting aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide, including: the preservation of biodiversity; the protection of human health during recreational use and through the provision of drinking water; the support of human nutrition through the provision of fish and water for irrigation; the enabling of a variety of economic activities; and the strengthening of the resilience of people against water-related disasters. Good ambient water quality is therefore closely linked to the achievement of many other Sustainable Development Goals.Target 6.3 aims at improving water quality and indicator 6.3.2 provides a mechanism for determining whether, and to which extent, water quality management measures are contributing to the improvement of water quality over time. The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.1 on wastewater treatment because inadequate wastewater treatment leads to degradation in quality of the waters receiving the wastewater effluents. It directly informs progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on water-related ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal eutrophication).The methodology recognises that countries have different capacity levels to monitor water quality, with many developed countries operating extensive and complex programmes that collect and report data to existing reporting frameworks beyond the scope of this methodology. For these countries it is recognised that this methodology will not contribute to improving their water quality; however it must be sufficiently flexible to capture data from existing monitoring frameworks without burdening countries with additional reporting obligations. Conversely, many of the least developed countries currently do not monitor water quality or operate very limited monitoring programmes. The methodology must therefore allow these countries to contribute to the global indicator, according to their national capacity and available resources. The development of the methodology builds on best practice for water quality monitoring promoted by the UN Environment GEMS/Water programme since 1978 together with testing by several pilot countries during the Integrated Monitoring Initiative Proof of Concept phase of 2016, and external review by experts and international organizations. This led to revision of the original methodology, which was then further tested through the 2017 global data drive. The feedback received has contributed to the present refined methodology. Data sources:The recommended sources of data are water quality monitoring data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters in national or sub-national ambient water quality monitoring programmes implemented by governmental authorities. Additional water quality monitoring data from research or citizen-science monitoring programmes can be used to supplement the available authoritative monitoring data, provided they are authorised by the national reporting agency.The number of monitoring locations required to determine the quality status of a water body depends on the type and size of the water body, but a minimum of one monitoring location per water body is required. The minimum data requirements for calculating this indicator are measurements for all of the recommended or alternative core parameters appropriate to the type of water body as defined in the methodology. Measurements should be taken routinely, at prescribed intervals, or the same time of year each year, from the same locations. Even if new monitoring stations are introduced, data should continue to be collected from the original locations. This ensures that results are comparable between reports, thereby enabling trends to be established over time. The monitoring data needed for the indicator computation may be collected by different monitoring programmes involving different agencies and organizations. It is therefore important to establish and maintain centralized data repositories at the national level that collate the data from the various stakeholders, ensuring compatibility in reporting units between all agencies submitting data. Data should be compiled for each core parameter at each sampling location in order to calculate the indicator.   Collection process:The data will be collected by UN Environment and its Global Environment Monitoring System for Water (GEMS/Water) through electronic reporting in the global water quality information system GEMStat. At the national level, data reports will be provided by the GEMS/Water National Focal Points or any other official counterpart appointed by the respective government. GEMS/Water offers consultation and support in selecting and compiling the required monitoring data, defining suitable river basin districts and delineating water bodies, as well as computing the indicator, upon request through its helpdesk. Data reported by the countries will be checked for consistency with respect to the monitoring parameters, target values and spatial units and compared with monitoring data available in GEMStat, if applicable.

The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to new common literacy and numeracy scales currently in development. Fixed level of proficiency The fixed level of proficiency is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (literacy or numeracy) measured through learning assessments. Currently, there are no common standards validated by the international community or countries.

The measurement of youth and adult skills requires some form of direct assessment. Using household surveys to measure learning can be costly and difficult to administer and may underestimate learning in areas that are critical to daily life but are harder to assess in standardized approaches. The result may be inaccurate representations of what youth and adults know and can do, especially in relation to applying skills that may vary across contexts. The indicator is a direct measure of the skill levels of youth and adults in the two areas: literacy and numeracy. There is only one threshold that divides youth and adults into above and below minimum level: (a) Below minimum level is the proportion of youth and adults who do not achieve the minimum standard as set-up by countries according to the globally defined minimum competencies. (b) Above minimum level is the proportion of youth and adults who have achieved the minimum standard. Due to heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will have to be mapped to the globally defined basic and proficiency levels.

Two thresholds are used to define 'large household expenditure on health': greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income.     Indicator 3.8.2 is defined as the 'Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income'. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator). NumeratorHousehold expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, from any type of provider and for all members of the household. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct payments that are financed by a household's income (including remittances), savings or loans but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement. As such they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household  and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable source of funding for the health system.  The components of a household's health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent with division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) which currently  includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded .Further information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary characteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the international classification for health accounts and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the World Health Organization.  DenominatorExpenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household's long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic account during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure 'consumption' depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.The most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services . Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the 'comments and limitations' section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see section on data sources). ThresholdsIt is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption or income: a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25). With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship (see section on comments and limitations). It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty . These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1. However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.First, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). For those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement - for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. Second, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household's resources (see concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .Third, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes 'large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income'. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household's budget to health. Fourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. There are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a framework  which includes, in addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending Target 3.8 is defined as 'Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all'. The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household's budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to finance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received. This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a household's capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption or income. For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please consult   Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on 'Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report'. Data sources:The recommended data sources for the monitoring of the 'Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income' are household surveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures - for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure . The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.When socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2.  For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens .Collection process:WHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken. The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities.  The World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the following quality checks:For the denominator of the health expenditure ratio- Compare the logarithm of  total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey.  Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet  if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI) , computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita. - Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet  at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion. - Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.For the numerator of the health expenditure ratio- Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency.  When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED)  and the World Development Indicators Database (WDI) . Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).These benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff  et al 2018. At the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.In addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and the methodology simple.  Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just described.

Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services . Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the 'comments and limitations' section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see section on data sources). ThresholdsIt is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as share of total household consumption or income: a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25). With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship (see section on comments and limitations). It is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is used to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty . These surveys are also regularly conducted for other purposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically by NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden so long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be identified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, frequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1. However, indicator 3.8.2 has its own conceptual and empirical limitations.First, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does report any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party payer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator). For those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement - for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. Clearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of funding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always specifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement. Second, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by comparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household expenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household's resources (see concept section) but recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly robust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based measures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) .Third, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes 'large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income'. People just below such threshold are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is possible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household's budget to health. Fourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending could be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall period that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or sampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending could also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. There are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a framework  which includes, in addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence spending Target 3.8 is defined as 'Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all'. The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household's budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of provider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to finance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received. This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a household's capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption or income. For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please consult   Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on 'Tracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report'. Data sources:The recommended data sources for the monitoring of the 'Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income' are household surveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures - for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure . The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2 is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures.When socio-economic or living standards surveys are used to measure SDG indicator 3.8.2, any challenge for cross-country comparability of SDG Indicator 1.1.1 also applies to the monitoring of SDG indicator 3.8.2.  For any type of household survey, given the focus on household health expenditure there is a need to improve the current survey instruments for cross-country comparability. The World Health Organization is collaborating with different UN agencies and other important stakeholder to ensure this happens .Collection process:WHO obtains household survey data from national statistical offices where the denominator and numerator of the health expenditure ratio is constructed following their own guidelines either directly by them or by WHO consultants. WHO works through its regional offices or country offices to obtain access to data. No systematic adjustment is undertaken. The World Bank also typically receives data from National Statistical Offices (NSOs) directly. In other cases it uses NSO data received indirectly. For example, it receives data from Eurostat and from LIS (Luxembourg Income Study), who provide the World Bank NSO data they have received / harmonized. The Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina and the World Bank jointly maintain the SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin American and Caribbean) database that includes harmonized statistics on poverty and other distributional and social variables from 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, based on microdata from household surveys conducted by NSOs. Data is obtained through country specific programs, including technical assistance programs and joint analytical and capacity building activities. The World Bank has relationships with NSOs on work programs involving statistical systems and data analysis. Poverty economists from the World Bank typically engage with NSOs broadly on poverty measurement and analysis as part of technical assistance activities.  The World Health Organization and the World Bank generate indicator 3.8.2 following the same approach (see methodology). Both institutions combine estimates at the meso-level. Eligibility of the estimates included in a joint global database for the production of regional and global estimates is based on the following quality checks:For the denominator of the health expenditure ratio- Compare the logarithm of  total per capita consumption in a benchmark source with the logarithm of total per capita consumption estimated from the survey.  Both are expressed on a monthly basis in 2011 international (PPP) $. The benchmark source is taken from Povcalnet  if available, and otherwise from the World Development Indicators (WDI) , computed as the household final consumption expenditures in constant 2011 international divided by total population. When the difference between the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark source and the logarithm of the value estimated from the survey as a share of the logarithm of total per capita consumption in the benchmark is greater than 10% when the comparison is with PovcalNet and greater than 15% when the comparison is made with the WDI the survey point is identified as an outlier internationally in terms of consumption per capita. - Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet  at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in the incidence of extreme poverty and flagged for possible exclusion. - Compare the poverty headcount estimated from the survey at the $3.10 a day poverty line in 2011 PPPs with the poverty incidence reported in PovcalNet at the same poverty line (benchmark value). When the absolute difference between the benchmark value   and the survey estimate exceeds 10 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in poverty headcount at $3.10 a day and flagged for possible exclusion.For the numerator of the health expenditure ratio- Compare the average health expenditure ratio in the survey to a benchmark average budget share constructed as the ratio of the aggregate measure of household out-of-pocket expenditures in current local currency and aggregate household final consumption expenditure in current local currency.  When the absolute difference exceeds 5 percentage points the survey point is identified as an outlier in terms of household budget share spent on health and flagged for possible exclusion. The macro-indicator of household out-of-pocket expenditures is available from the Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED)  and the World Development Indicators Database (WDI) . Information on household final consumption expenditure is also extracted from WDI (series code: NE.CON.PRVT.CN).These benchmarks are also used to decide between two estimates for those countries and those years for which both institutions have the same data source. For more information please refer to WHO and World Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff  et al 2018. At the end of the quality assurance process, WHO and the World Bank assemble non-duplicated estimates of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income for each country. The World Health Organization then undertakes a country consultation process. Following a WHO Executive Board resolution (EB107.R8) WHO is requested to do this before publishing estimates at country level on behalf of member states. For any given indicator, this process starts with WHO sending a formal request to ministries of health to nominate a focal point for the consultation on the indicator. Once member states nominate focal points, WHO then sends draft estimates and methodological descriptions to them. STATA codes are available to reproduce the estimates shared. The focal points then send to WHO their comments, often including new data or revised country estimates that are used to update the country estimates. During the 2017 country consultation 137 WHO Member States nominated focal points, 100 of these received draft estimates and information on the methodology; 37 received only information on methodology as no draft estimate was produced. Of the 57 WHO Member States without focal points nominated estimates are available for 32 of them.In addition to such consultation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank regularly undertake training events on the measurement of lack of financial protection coverage, which involves participants from the Ministry of Health as well as from the National Statistical Office. WHO has several regional and national collaborations ongoing to support the production of indicator 3.8.2 as it has been recently adopted it is not yet routinely produced by National Statistical Office despite the data being available and the methodology simple.  Results of such collaborations are not yet included in the database assembled by WHO and the World Bank but estimates produced by a country will be subject to the same quality assurance process just described.

"SDG_SL_TLF_CHLDEC","Proportion of children engaged in economic activity and household chores, by sex and age (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of children engaged in economic activity and household chores, by sex and age (%) The number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in child labour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children in child labour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the population.  For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17. Child labour (child labor) Three principal international legal instruments – ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (C138), United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182) together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and international actions against it.  In accordance with these instruments, child labour is work that children should not be doing because (a) they are too young or (b) is likely to harm their health, safety or morals, due to its nature or the conditions in which it is carried out. The resolutions adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), the world’s acknowledged standard-setting body in the area of labour statistics, provide the basis for translating the legal standards governing the concept of child labour into statistical terms for the purpose of child labour measurement. In accordance with the ICLS resolutions , child labour can be measured on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) or on the basis of the general production boundary. The former limits the frame of reference to economic activity, while the latter extends it to include both economic activity and unpaid household services, that is, the production of domestic and personal services by a household member for consumption within their own household, commonly called 'household chores'. Following from this, two indicators are used for measuring child labour for the purpose of SDG reporting, the first based on the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) and the second based on the general production boundary. Indicator 1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (SNA production boundary basis) Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range: children working at least 1 hour per week in economic activity;Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range: children working for at least 14 hours per week in economic activity;Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range: children working for more than 43 hours per week in economic activity.Indicator 2: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities and household chores at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (general production boundary basis):Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range: children working at least 1 hour per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for more than 21 hours per week;Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range: children working for at least 14 hours per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for more than 21 hours per week;Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range: children working for more than 43 hours per week in economic activity. The concept of child labour also includes the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous (18th ICLS paragraphs 33 to 34) as well as hazardous work (18th ICLS paragraphs 21 to 32). The worst forms of child labour include all forms of slavery or similar practices such as trafficking and the recruitment and use of child soldiers, the use or procurement of children for prostitution or other illicit activities, and other work that is likely to harm children’s health, safety or well-being.NANA Children aged 5-17: Number of children aged 5-17 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population, multiplied by 100. Children aged 5-14: Number of children aged 5-14 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 5-14 in the population, multiplied by 100. Children aged 15-17: Number of children aged 15-17 reported child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 15-17 in the population, multiplied by 100. While the concept of child labour includes working in activities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of estimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond age-specific hourly thresholds are used as a proxy for hazardous work for the purpose of reporting on SDG indicator 8.7.1. Further methodological work is needed to validate questions specifically aimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions.Similarly, while the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous also form part of the concept of child labour more broadly, data on the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in regular household surveys given difficulties with accurately and reliably measuring it. Therefore, this element of child labour is not captured by the indicators used for reporting on SDG 8.7.1.  In addition, ‘own use production of goods’, including activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, falls within the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). However, for the purpose of SDG reporting of indicator 8.7.1, and with the goal of facilitating international comparability, fetching water and collecting firewood have been classified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores), a form of production that lies outside the SNA production boundary. More broadly, child labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful benchmarks for international comparative purposes but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on national child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers’ and employers’ organizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).  This means that there is no single legal definition of child labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national legislation across countries. Far too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future and our collective futures. According to the latest ILO global estimates, about 152 million children worldwide – 64 million girls and 88 million boys - are child labourers, accounting for almost 10 percent of the child population.  These stark figures underscore the need for accelerated progress against child labour in the lead up to the 2025 target date for ending child labour in all its forms, and the accompanying need for child labour statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this regard.  Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on the nature and extent of child labour provide a basis for determining priorities for national global action against child labour. Statistical information on child labour, and more broadly on all working children, also provide a basis for increasing public awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks and policies. Data sources: Household surveys such as National Labour Force Surveys, National Multipurpose Household Surveys, UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), ILO-supported Statistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC), and World bank Living Standard Measurement surveys (LSMS) are among the most important instruments for generating information on child labour in developing countries. Estimates of child labour generated by these survey instruments are increasingly relied on by countries to monitor progress towards national and global child labour elimination targets. Many countries also produce national labour estimates and reports that often include data on child labour and/or employment among children. Collection process:UNICEF undertakes a wide consultative process of compiling and assessing data from national sources for the purposes of updating its global databases on the situation of children. Up until 2017, the mechanism UNICEF used to collaborate with national authorities on ensuring data quality and international comparability on key indicators of relevance to children was known as Country Data Reporting on the Indicators for the Goals (CRING).	As of 2018, UNICEF launched a new country consultation process with national authorities on selected child-related global SDG indicators it is custodian or co-custodian to meet emerging standards and guidelines on data flows for global reporting of SDG indicators, which place strong emphasis on technical rigour, country ownership and use of official data and statistics. The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. The results of this country consultation are reviewed and discussed with ILO. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why.

The proportion of children in child labour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the population.  For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17. Child labour (child labor) Three principal international legal instruments – ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (C138), United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182) together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and international actions against it.  In accordance with these instruments, child labour is work that children should not be doing because (a) they are too young or (b) is likely to harm their health, safety or morals, due to its nature or the conditions in which it is carried out. The resolutions adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), the world’s acknowledged standard-setting body in the area of labour statistics, provide the basis for translating the legal standards governing the concept of child labour into statistical terms for the purpose of child labour measurement. In accordance with the ICLS resolutions , child labour can be measured on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) or on the basis of the general production boundary. The former limits the frame of reference to economic activity, while the latter extends it to include both economic activity and unpaid household services, that is, the production of domestic and personal services by a household member for consumption within their own household, commonly called 'household chores'. Following from this, two indicators are used for measuring child labour for the purpose of SDG reporting, the first based on the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) and the second based on the general production boundary. Indicator 1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (SNA production boundary basis) Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range: children working at least 1 hour per week in economic activity;Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range: children working for at least 14 hours per week in economic activity;Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range: children working for more than 43 hours per week in economic activity.Indicator 2: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities and household chores at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (general production boundary basis):Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range: children working at least 1 hour per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for more than 21 hours per week;Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range: children working for at least 14 hours per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for more than 21 hours per week;Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range: children working for more than 43 hours per week in economic activity. The concept of child labour also includes the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous (18th ICLS paragraphs 33 to 34) as well as hazardous work (18th ICLS paragraphs 21 to 32). The worst forms of child labour include all forms of slavery or similar practices such as trafficking and the recruitment and use of child soldiers, the use or procurement of children for prostitution or other illicit activities, and other work that is likely to harm children’s health, safety or well-being.NANA Children aged 5-17: Number of children aged 5-17 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 5-17 in the population, multiplied by 100. Children aged 5-14: Number of children aged 5-14 reported in child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 5-14 in the population, multiplied by 100. Children aged 15-17: Number of children aged 15-17 reported child labour during the week prior to the survey divided by the total number of children aged 15-17 in the population, multiplied by 100. While the concept of child labour includes working in activities that are hazardous in nature, to ensure comparability of estimates over time and to minimize data quality issues, work beyond age-specific hourly thresholds are used as a proxy for hazardous work for the purpose of reporting on SDG indicator 8.7.1. Further methodological work is needed to validate questions specifically aimed at identifying children in hazardous working conditions.Similarly, while the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous also form part of the concept of child labour more broadly, data on the worst forms of child labour are not currently captured in regular household surveys given difficulties with accurately and reliably measuring it. Therefore, this element of child labour is not captured by the indicators used for reporting on SDG 8.7.1.  In addition, ‘own use production of goods’, including activities such as fetching water and collecting firewood, falls within the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). However, for the purpose of SDG reporting of indicator 8.7.1, and with the goal of facilitating international comparability, fetching water and collecting firewood have been classified as unpaid household services (i.e., household chores), a form of production that lies outside the SNA production boundary. More broadly, child labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful benchmarks for international comparative purposes but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on national child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the discretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers’ and employers’ organizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).  This means that there is no single legal definition of child labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national legislation across countries. Far too many children in the world remain trapped in child labour, compromising their individual future and our collective futures. According to the latest ILO global estimates, about 152 million children worldwide – 64 million girls and 88 million boys - are child labourers, accounting for almost 10 percent of the child population.  These stark figures underscore the need for accelerated progress against child labour in the lead up to the 2025 target date for ending child labour in all its forms, and the accompanying need for child labour statistics to monitor and guide efforts in this regard.  Reliable, comprehensive and timely data on the nature and extent of child labour provide a basis for determining priorities for national global action against child labour. Statistical information on child labour, and more broadly on all working children, also provide a basis for increasing public awareness of the situation of working children and for the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks and policies. Data sources: Household surveys such as National Labour Force Surveys, National Multipurpose Household Surveys, UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), ILO-supported Statistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC), and World bank Living Standard Measurement surveys (LSMS) are among the most important instruments for generating information on child labour in developing countries.

"SDG_EG_TBA_H2CO","Proportion of transboundary basins (river and lake basins and aquifers) with an operational arrangement for water cooperation (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of transboundary basins (river and lake basins and aquifers) with an operational arrangement for water cooperation (%) The proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation is defined as the proportion of transboundary basins area within a country with an operational arrangement for water cooperation. It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those transboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. 'transboundary' basins) that are covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in a country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain it expressed as percentage share. Transboundary basins The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are operational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered 'operational' seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for cooperation in water management.                               Transboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, lakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. For the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the catchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer.                               Arrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities.                     Operational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of understanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the following criteria needs to be fulfilled:                         - There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation           - There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings           - There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set          - There is a regular exchange of data and information.NANA Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifersWhile the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers requires investigations.If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable.Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sumCommonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of systems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on transboundary aquifers. The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be used to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement exists on either one).Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify which transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangementSome operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate the indicator value.In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such cases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for calculating the indicator value. At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation arrangements (and their respective areas). Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management are operationalThe following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational:- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation - regularity of formal communication in form of meetings - existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives - regular exchange of information and data If any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This information is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin reporting systems.Step 5 Calculate the indicator value, that is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those transboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share. The spatial information on transboundary surface water basins' boundaries and the extents of the catchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no updating need is expected.The information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information is generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical studies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification of additional transboundary aquifers.In situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such complementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from the reporting at the national level. The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters is commonly a long process that takes many years. The operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could potentially be observed. Most of the world's water resources are shared: 592 transboundary aquifers have been identified and transboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth's land surface and account for an estimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in river and lake basins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development of water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive water use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries' development aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is in most cases not advanced. Specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key precondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as reflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing experience and good practices, all point to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured by the four criteria for operationality.This is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and the importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the advancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).Progress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of indicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with co-riparian countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing activities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover all surface waters and groundwaters. Data sources:At the country level, ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources (depends on the country but commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or agriculture; institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically have the spatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer delineations (as Geographical Information Systems shapefiles). Information on existing arrangement and their operationality is also commonly available from the same institutions.Regular reporting contributing to the information collectionReporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the indicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as operationality. The Convention's regular reporting on transboundary water cooperation, involving both Parties and non-Parties to the Convention, will collect this information every 3 years as of 2017. The reporting covers trans-boundary rivers, lakes and ground waters. UNESCO IHP will contribute to the reporting on transboundary aquifers. More than 100 countries participate in the Water Convention's activities. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe acts as Secretariat for the Water Convention.Some countries already report to regional organizations on the advancement of transboundary water cooperation, and similar arrangements could be strengthened and facilitated.In the absence of available information at the national level global datasets on transboundary basins as well as about agreements and organizations for transboundary cooperation are available, which could be used in the absence of more detailed information, in the short term in particular.Delineations of transboundary basinsIn global databases, the most up-to-date delineations are available through the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP). TWAP covered 286 main transboundary rivers, 206 transboundary lakes and reservoirs and 199 transboundary aquifers. Relevant information have also been compiled for 592 transboundary aquifers by the UNESCO ISARM project. Cooperation arrangementsExistence of treaties is available from the International Freshwater Treaties Database, maintained by Oregon State University (OSU). This was last updated to include all arrangements up to 2008. The treaty database includes in total 686 international freshwater treaties. Organizations for transboundary water cooperation: International River Basin Organization (RBO) Database detailed information about over 120 international river basin organizations, including bilateral commissions, around the world. Regional assessments describing and inventorying agreements have been undertaken, contributing to the baseline globally, for example, regional inventories of transboundary aquifers under the UNESCO-IHP ISARM.Collection process:Data are not so far included in the National Statistical Systems but the information needed to calculate the indicator is simple, does not require advanced monitoring capacities and is normally available to all countries.Spatial information ('transboundary basin area') is normally available in ministries in charge of water resources. Regarding operationality of arrangement the data needed for calculating the indicator can be directly obtained from information from administrative records (Member States have records of cooperation arrangements). The limitations in terms of comparability of the results between countries are the same as the ones described in Section 12. However, a clear definition and consideration of the criteria as developed in the detailed methodology currently tested under the UN-Water GEMI initiative and that will be available to countries ensure a common reference for the countries.Moreover, the elements of the indicator are based on the main principles of customary international water law, also contained in the two UN conventions - Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York, 1997) and the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992) - as well as the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124 and 66/104).The proposed mechanism of reporting under the water Convention will allow also having sub-components of the indicator reported by countries, which will ensure both more confidence on the final indicator value (validation) and increased comparability.

Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in river and lake basins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development of water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive water use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries' development aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is in most cases not advanced. Specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key precondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as reflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing experience and good practices, all point to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured by the four criteria for operationality.This is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and the importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the advancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).Progress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of indicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with co-riparian countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing activities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover all surface waters and groundwaters. Data sources:At the country level, ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources (depends on the country but commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or agriculture; institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically have the spatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer delineations (as Geographical Information Systems shapefiles). Information on existing arrangement and their operationality is also commonly available from the same institutions.Regular reporting contributing to the information collectionReporting under the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) will also gather the information needed for the calculation of the indicator, especially on the cooperation arrangements, transboundary waters covered by them as well as operationality. The Convention's regular reporting on transboundary water cooperation, involving both Parties and non-Parties to the Convention, will collect this information every 3 years as of 2017. The reporting covers trans-boundary rivers, lakes and ground waters. UNESCO IHP will contribute to the reporting on transboundary aquifers. More than 100 countries participate in the Water Convention's activities. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe acts as Secretariat for the Water Convention.Some countries already report to regional organizations on the advancement of transboundary water cooperation, and similar arrangements could be strengthened and facilitated.In the absence of available information at the national level global datasets on transboundary basins as well as about agreements and organizations for transboundary cooperation are available, which could be used in the absence of more detailed information, in the short term in particular.Delineations of transboundary basinsIn global databases, the most up-to-date delineations are available through the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP). TWAP covered 286 main transboundary rivers, 206 transboundary lakes and reservoirs and 199 transboundary aquifers. Relevant information have also been compiled for 592 transboundary aquifers by the UNESCO ISARM project. Cooperation arrangementsExistence of treaties is available from the International Freshwater Treaties Database, maintained by Oregon State University (OSU). This was last updated to include all arrangements up to 2008. The treaty database includes in total 686 international freshwater treaties. Organizations for transboundary water cooperation: International River Basin Organization (RBO) Database detailed information about over 120 international river basin organizations, including bilateral commissions, around the world. Regional assessments describing and inventorying agreements have been undertaken, contributing to the baseline globally, for example, regional inventories of transboundary aquifers under the UNESCO-IHP ISARM.Collection process:Data are not so far included in the National Statistical Systems but the information needed to calculate the indicator is simple, does not require advanced monitoring capacities and is normally available to all countries.Spatial information ('transboundary basin area') is normally available in ministries in charge of water resources. Regarding operationality of arrangement the data needed for calculating the indicator can be directly obtained from information from administrative records (Member States have records of cooperation arrangements). The limitations in terms of comparability of the results between countries are the same as the ones described in Section 12. However, a clear definition and consideration of the criteria as developed in the detailed methodology currently tested under the UN-Water GEMI initiative and that will be available to countries ensure a common reference for the countries.Moreover, the elements of the indicator are based on the main principles of customary international water law, also contained in the two UN conventions - Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York, 1997) and the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992) - as well as the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124 and 66/104).The proposed mechanism of reporting under the water Convention will allow also having sub-components of the indicator reported by countries, which will ensure both more confidence on the final indicator value (validation) and increased comparability.

"SDG_EG_TBA_H2CORL","Proportion of transboundary river and lake basins with an operational arrangement for water cooperation (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of transboundary river and lake basins with an operational arrangement for water cooperation (%) The proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation is defined as the proportion of transboundary basins area within a country with an operational arrangement for water cooperation. It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those transboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. 'transboundary' basins) that are covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in a country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to obtain it expressed as percentage share. Transboundary basins The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are operational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered 'operational' seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for cooperation in water management.                               Transboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, lakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. For the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the catchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer.                               Arrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities.                     Operational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of understanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the following criteria needs to be fulfilled:                         - There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation           - There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings           - There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set          - There is a regular exchange of data and information.NANA Step 1 Identify the transboundary surface waters and aquifersWhile the identification of transboundary surface water is straightforward, the identification of transboundary aquifers requires investigations.If there are no transboundary surface waters or groundwaters, reporting is not applicable.Step 2 Calculate the surface area of each transboundary basin and the total sumCommonly at least the basins of the rivers and lakes have been delineated through topographic maps and the basin area is known or easily measurable. The total transboundary surface area in the country is the sum of the surface areas in the country of each of the transboundary basins and aquifers (expressed in km2). Transboundary areas for different types of systems (e.g. river basin and aquifer) or multiple aquifers may overlap. The area of transboundary aquifers, even if located within a transboundary river basin, should be added to be able to track progress of cooperation on transboundary aquifers. The calculations can most easily be carried with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Once generated, with appropriate tools for spatial analysis, the shapes of the surface catchments and the aquifers can be used to report both disaggregated (for the surface water basin or aquifer) and aggregated (agreement exists on either one).Step 3 Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify which transboundary waters are covered by a cooperation arrangementSome operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary waters in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters. In such cases, it should be clear that the geographical extent of both is used to calculate the indicator value.In other cases, the area of application may be limited to a border section of the watercourse and in such cases only the corresponding area should be considered as potentially having an operational arrangement for calculating the indicator value. At the end of this step, it should be known which transboundary basins are covered by cooperation arrangements (and their respective areas). Step 4 Check which of the existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management are operationalThe following check-list allows determining whether the cooperation arrangement on a particular basin or in relation to a particular co-riparian country is operational:- existence of a joint body, joint mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation - regularity of formal communication in form of meetings - existence of joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or of joint objectives - regular exchange of information and data If any of the conditions is not met, the cooperation arrangement cannot be considered operational. This information is currently available in countries and can also be withdrawn from global, regional or basin reporting systems.Step 5 Calculate the indicator value, that is, the area share by adding up the surface area in the country of those transboundary surface water basins or aquifers that are covered by an operational cooperation arrangement and dividing it by the total summed up area in the country of all transboundary basins (including aquifers), multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage share. The spatial information on transboundary surface water basins' boundaries and the extents of the catchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no updating need is expected.The information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information is generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical studies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification of additional transboundary aquifers.In situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such complementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from the reporting at the national level. The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters is commonly a long process that takes many years. The operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could potentially be observed. Most of the world's water resources are shared: 592 transboundary aquifers have been identified and transboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth's land surface and account for an estimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in river and lake basins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development of water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive water use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries' development aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is in most cases not advanced. Specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key precondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

Stakeholder participation Stakeholder participation is essential to ensure the sustainability of water and sanitation management options over time, e.g. the choice of appropriate solutions for a given social and economic context, and the full understanding of the impacts of a certain development decision. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability. Local administrative units Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. Policies and procedures for participation of local communities Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) questionnaire provides information on whether there are 'clearly defined procedures in laws or policies for participation by service users (e.g. households) and communities in planning programs'. For countries that have data available from the local administrative unit level, they are asked to provide data on the number of local administrative units for which policies and procedures for local participation (i) exist, and (ii) are operational, as well as (iii) the number of local administrative units assessed, and (iv) the total number of units in the country. The indicator is computed as (ii) the number of local admin units with operation policies and procedures for local participation divided by (iv) the total number of local administrative units in the country.Both numerator and denominator will be obtained through the GLAAS survey for the 2016-2017 cycle. Data on local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for local participation is being collected through the current cycle of GLAAS, and will be available by end-2016. Until then, the presence of policies and procedures as reported at the national level for different subsectors will be reported.Additional data, including data measuring local participation from the OECD Water Governance Indicators and administrative data, will be progressively included in the calculation of the indicator as they become available. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services. Data sources:The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) provides information on governance, monitoring, human resources, and financing in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The UN-Water GLAAS survey is currently conducted on a biennial basis, led by WHO, and collected data from 94 countries (predominantly low and lower-middle income countries) in the most recent cycle in 2013-2014. The scope of the question on community and user participation has been expanded beyond WASH for the 2016-17 GLAAS cycle to address all targets in SDG 6, including water quality, water rights/allocation, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems. GLAAS has completed three full cycles (2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014), as well as a pilot conducted in 2008. National governments participating in the GLAAS survey fill out the questionnaire, preferably supported by a multi-stakeholder review. Although one ministry leads the process, it is often the case that many different ministries and departments must be involved in the process in order to obtain the data required to complete the questionnaire. A GLAAS national focal person supports the lead ministry to coordinate data collection, to compile the national response to the questionnaire, and to lead on the process of data validation.The data will be complemented by Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) reporting in SDG target 6.5 (for wastewater and water quality, water efficiency, water resource management, and the status of water-related ecosystems) (UNEP 2016). A key component of IWRM is community participation and management of water resources at the local level. The analysis of IWRM has been done in the past by UN-Water in 2008 (led by UN-DESA) and in 2012 (led by UNEP, UNDP, GWP and SIWI) as requested by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (UN-Water 2008, 2012).The OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI), a technical platform gathering 100+ members from the public, private and non-for-profit sectors, is currently developing a set of Water Governance Indicators, within the implementation strategy of the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD 2015a). The Water Governance Indicators are expected to be able to provide additional information on local participation on the basis of an indicators system proposed in OECD (2015b) for measuring 'stakeholder engagement for inclusive water governance'. An indicator providing metrics on local participation will be developed and tested by 2017.

The tracer indicators are as follows, organized by four broad categories of service coverage:I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health1. Family planning: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15â<U+0088><U+0092>49 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods 2. Pregnancy and delivery care: Percentage of women aged 15-49 years with a live birth in a given time period who received antenatal care four or more times3. Child immunization: Percentage of infants receiving three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccine4. Child treatment: Percentage of children under 5 years of age with suspected pneumonia (cough and difficult breathing NOT due to a problem in the chest and a blocked nose) in the two weeks preceding the survey taken to an appropriate health facility or providerII. Infectious diseases5. Tuberculosis: Percentage of incident TB cases that are detected and successfully treated6. HIV/AIDS: Percentage of people living with HIV currently receiving antiretroviral therapy7. Malaria: Percentage of population in malaria-endemic areas who slept under an insecticide-treated net the previous night [only for countries with high malaria burden]8. Water and sanitation: Percentage of households using at least basic sanitation facilitiesIII. Noncommunicable diseases9. Hypertension: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) among adults aged 18 years and older10. Diabetes: Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years and older11. Tobacco: Age-standardized prevalence of adults >=15 years not smoking tobacco in last 30 days (SDG indicator 3.a.1, metadata available here)IV. Service capacity and access12. Hospital access:  Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per 10,000 population13. Health workforce: Health professionals (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum thresholds for each cadre (partial overlap with SDG indicator 3.c.1, see metadata here)14. Health security: International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is the average percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained (SDG indicator 3.d.1, see metadata here)NANA The index is computed with geometric means, based on the methods used for the Human Development Index. The calculation of the 3.8.1 indicator requires first preparing the 14 tracer indicators so that they can be combined into the index, and then computing the index from those values. The 14 tracer indicators are first all placed on the same scale, with 0 being the lowest value and 100 being the optimal value. For most indicators, this scale is the natural scale of measurement, e.g., the percentage of infants who have been immunized ranges from 0 to 100 percent. However, for a few indicators additional rescaling is required to obtain appropriate values from 0 to 100, as follows:- Rescaling based on a non-zero minimum to obtain finer resolution (this 'stretches' the distribution across countries): prevalence of non-raised blood pressure and prevalence of non-use of tobacco are both rescaled using a minimum value of 50%.rescaled value = (X-50)/(100-50)*100- Rescaling for a continuous measure: mean fasting plasma glucose, which is a continuous measure (units of mmol/L), is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 using the minimum theoretical biological risk (5.1 mmol/L) and observed maximum across countries (7.1 mmol/L).rescaled value = (7.1 - original value)/(7.1-5.1)*100- Maximum thresholds for rate indicators: hospital bed density and health workforce density are both capped at maximum thresholds, and values above this threshold are held constant at 100. These thresholds are based on minimum values observed across OECD countries.rescaled hospital beds per 10,000 = minimum(100, original value / 18*100)		rescaled physicians per 1,000         = minimum(100, original value / 0.9*100)		rescaled psychiatrists per 100,000 = minimum(100, original value / 1*100)		rescaled surgeons per 100,000       = minimum(100, original value / 14*100)Once all tracer indicator values are on a scale of 0 to 100, geometric means are computed within each of the four health service areas, and then a geometric mean is taken of those four values. If the value of a tracer indicator happens to be zero, it is set to 1 (out of 100) before computing the geometric mean. The following diagram illustrates the calculations.                Note that in countries with low malaria burden, the tracer indicator for use of insecticide-treated nets is dropped from the calculation. These tracer indicators are meant to be indicative of service coverage, not a complete or exhaustive list of health services and interventions that are required for universal health coverage. The 14 tracer indicators were selected because they are well-established, with available data widely reported by countries (or expected to become widely available soon). Therefore, the index can be computed with existing data sources and does not require initiating new data collection efforts solely to inform the index. Target 3.8 is defined as 'Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all'.  The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for health service coverage and indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household's budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly.Countries provide many essential services for health protection, promotion, prevention, treatment and care. Indicators of service coverage - defined as people receiving the service they need - are the best way to track progress in providing services under universal health coverage (UHC). Since a single health service indicator does not suffice for monitoring UHC, an index is constructed from 14 tracer indicators selected based on epidemiological and statistical criteria. This includes several indicators that are already included in other SDG targets, thereby minimizing the data collection and reporting burden. The index is reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the optimal value. Data sources: Many of the tracer indicators of health service coverage are measured by household surveys. However, administrative data, facility data, facility surveys, and sentinel surveillance systems are utilized for certain indicators. Underlying data sources for each of the 14 tracer indicators are explained in more detail in Annex 1.In terms of values used to compute the index, values are taken from existing published sources. This includes assembled data sets and estimates from various UN agencies. This is summarized in the above link.Collection process: The mechanisms for collecting data from countries vary across the 14 tracer indicators, however in many cases a UN agency or interagency group has assembled and analysed relevant national data sources and then conducted a formal country consultation with country governments to review or produce comparable country estimates. For the UHC service coverage index, once this existing information on the 14 tracer indicators is collated, WHO conducts a country consultation with nominated focal points from national governments to review inputs and the calculation of the index. WHO does not undertake new estimation activities to produce tracer indicator values for the service coverage index; rather, the index is designed to make use of existing and well-established indicator data series to reduce reporting burden.

It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to the government. Government expenditure on education Government expenditure on education covers educational expenditure by all levels of government (local, regional, central) on the formal education system, from early childhood to tertiary education, in both public and private instructional and non-instructional institutions within the borders of a country. Expenditure on education Expenditure on education includes expenditure on core educational goods and services, such as teaching staff, school buildings, or school books and teaching materials, and peripheral educational goods and services such as ancillary services, general administration and other activities.NA Total government expenditure for a given level of education (e.g. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) is expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure (all sectors). A high proportion of government expenditure on education demonstrates a high government priority for education relative to other public investments. When interpreting this indicator one should keep in mind that some governments have more (or fewer) financial resources and therefore larger (or smaller) overall budgets, and that countries with younger populations may spend more on education relative to other sectors such as health or social security, and vice-versa. The Education 2030 Framework for Action has endorsed a benchmark for this indicator, which encourages countries to allocate at least 15% to 20% of their public expenditure to education.      In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refer only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries may also spend a part of their budget on educational activities. Although the IMF aims to publish data on total general government expenditure following common definitions based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual, in practice this concept (and what it includes) may differ between countries. The indicator is used to assess a government's emphasis on education relative to its investments in other sectors. The indicator shows how much of a priority education is for a given government, over time or in comparison with other countries. Data sources: Annual financial reports by national Ministries of Finance or Ministries of Education, or national accounts reports by National Statistical Offices.      Collection process:      Data on education expenditure are submitted by country governments in response to the annual UIS survey on formal education or to the UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection.       Data on total general government expenditure (all sectors) are obtained from the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook database and are updated once a year.

"SDG_ER_H2O_IWRMD","Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (%) Indicator 6.5.1 is 'degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)'. It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100.  The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as 'a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.' (GWP 2010). The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).       Integrated water resources management (IWRM) The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: 1.	Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the 'enabling environment' for IWRM. 2.	Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. 3.	Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. 4.	Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the 'National level' and 'Other levels' respectively. 'Other levels' includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 'implement [IWRM] at all levels .'.NANA 1.	The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. 2.	Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:- Very low (0)- Low (20)- Medium-low (40)- Medium-high (60)- High (80)- Very high (100)Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. 3.	The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 - 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. 4.	The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100. The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: a.	Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. b.	Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. c.	Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which will require a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of 'leaving no on behind'. The indicator provides a direct progress measurement of the first part of Target 6.5 '.implement integrated water resources management at all levels .'. The indicator score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with '0' interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and '100' interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented.        To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized as follows: Degree of implementation | Score range | General interpretation for overall IWRM scoreVery high	| 91 - 100	| Vast majority of IWRM elements are fully implemented, with objectives consistently achieved, and plans and programmes periodically assessed and revised.High	| 71 - 90	| IWRM objectives of plans and programmes are generally met, and geographic coverage and stakeholder engagement is generally good.Medium-high	| 51 - 70	| Capacity to implement elements of IWRM is generally adequate, and elements are generally being implemented under long-term programmes.Medium-low	| 31 - 50	| Elements of IWRM are generally institutionalized, and implementation is underway.Low	| 11 - 30	| Implementation of elements of IWRM has generally begun, but with limited uptake across the country, and potentially low engagement of stakeholder groups.Very low	| 0 - 10	| Development of elements of IWRM has generally not begun, or has stalled.The concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. Countries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. Indicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 'Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation', which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 '., including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.' Data sources:Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. The ministry is invited to nominate a national 'IWRM focal point', who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a 'ladder' approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. 1.	The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score.2.	The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders.

It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100.  The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as 'a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.' (GWP 2010). The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).       Integrated water resources management (IWRM) The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: 1.	Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the 'enabling environment' for IWRM. 2.	Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. 3.	Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. 4.	Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the 'National level' and 'Other levels' respectively. 'Other levels' includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 'implement [IWRM] at all levels .'.NANA 1.	The survey contains 33 questions divided into the four main sections described above. 2.	Each question is given a score between 0 and 100, in increments of 10, guided by threshold descriptions for the following 6 categories:- Very low (0)- Low (20)- Medium-low (40)- Medium-high (60)- High (80)- Very high (100)Note that guidance is provided for each threshold for each question, to ensure objective and comparable results. 3.	The un-weighted average of the question scores within each of the four sections is calculated to give a score of 0 - 100 for each section, rounded to the nearest whole number. 4.	The section scores (rounded to the nearest whole number), are averaged (un-weighted), and rounded to the nearest whole number, to give the indicator score, expressed as a number between 0 and 100. The challenge of subjectivity in responses associated with this type of survey is being addressed in a number of ways: a.	Draft responses are reviewed by a number of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in an open, inclusive and transparent process. b.	Countries are encouraged to provide further information to qualify their responses and/or set them in the national context. c.	Guidelines are provided for each of the four main sections, each question, and each of the six thresholds for every single question, to ensure responses are as objective as possible, and are comparable both between countries, and between reporting periods. To achieve robust indicator results requires a country process involving a wide range of stakeholders which will require a certain amount of time and resources. The advantage of this is that it puts in place a process that addresses the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDG targets, as well as stressing the importance of 'leaving no on behind'. The indicator provides a direct progress measurement of the first part of Target 6.5 '.implement integrated water resources management at all levels .'. The indicator score provides an easy and understandable way of measuring progress towards the target, with '0' interpreted as no implementation of IWRM, and '100' interpreted as IWRM being fully implemented.        To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized as follows: Degree of implementation | Score range | General interpretation for overall IWRM scoreVery high	| 91 - 100	| Vast majority of IWRM elements are fully implemented, with objectives consistently achieved, and plans and programmes periodically assessed and revised.High	| 71 - 90	| IWRM objectives of plans and programmes are generally met, and geographic coverage and stakeholder engagement is generally good.Medium-high	| 51 - 70	| Capacity to implement elements of IWRM is generally adequate, and elements are generally being implemented under long-term programmes.Medium-low	| 31 - 50	| Elements of IWRM are generally institutionalized, and implementation is underway.Low	| 11 - 30	| Implementation of elements of IWRM has generally begun, but with limited uptake across the country, and potentially low engagement of stakeholder groups.Very low	| 0 - 10	| Development of elements of IWRM has generally not begun, or has stalled.The concept of the survey is that it provides sufficient information to be of real value to the countries in determining their progress towards the target, and through this, various aspects of IWRM. A balance has been sought between providing sufficient information to cover the core principles of IWRM, and thus providing a robust indicator value, and not overburdening countries with unnecessary reporting requirements. Countries are encouraged to provide additional information on each question, which may help to qualify their choice of score, and/or put that score into their national context. Indicator 6.5.1 is supported by indicator 6.5.2 'Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation', which directly addresses the portion of Target 6.5 '., including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.' Data sources:Monitoring progress on meeting SDG 6.5 is owned by and is the responsibility of the national government. The government will assign a ministry with the primary responsibility for overseeing this survey, which will be asked to take on the responsibility of coordinating the national IWRM monitoring and reporting process. As water management issues cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the survey. The ministry is invited to nominate a national 'IWRM focal point', who may or may not be a government official. The UN will provide support where needed and possible. The following steps are suggested as guidance only, as it is up to countries to decide which process or processes would best serve their needs. It should also be noted that the following steps represent a 'ladder' approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. 1.	The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score.2.	The completed draft survey is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. 3.	The revised draft survey is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop.

"SDG_EN_H2O_RVAMBQ","Proportion of river water bodies with good ambient water quality (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of river water bodies with good ambient water quality (%) The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. Aquifer Geological formation capable of storing, transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of water. Classification of water quality If at least 80% of the monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a water body comply with their respective target values, the water body is classified as having a 'good' water quality status. Each water body is classified as being of 'good' or 'not good' status. Groundwater Subsurface water occupying the saturated zone. The indicator is computed by first classifying all assessed water bodies based on the compliance of the monitoring data collected for selected parameters at monitoring locations within the water body with parameter-specific target values:Cwq = (nc / nm) * 100Where  Cwq is the percentage compliance [%];  nc is the number of monitoring values in compliance with the target values;  nm is the total number of monitoring values.A threshold value of 80% compliance is defined to classify water bodies as 'good' quality. Thus, a body of water is classified as having a good quality status if at least 80% of all monitoring data from all monitoring stations within the water body are in compliance with the respective targets.In a second step, the classification results are used to compute the indicator as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having a good quality status to the total number of classified water bodies expressed in percentage:WBGQ = (ng / nt) * 100Where  WBGQ is the percentage of water bodies classified as having a good quality status;  ng is the number of classified water bodies classified as having a good quality status;  nc is the total number of monitored and classified water bodies. The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 6.3.2 requires considerable national financial and human capacities to regularly measure water quality parameters at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, and to consistently collect, quality-assure and process the monitoring data to compute the indicator. Substantial investments in monitoring and data management infrastructures, as well as targeted capacity development in water quality monitoring programme design and operation, will be required in many countries to enhance national capacities to regularly and consistently report on the indicator. Recognizing the differences in monitoring and data processing capacities among countries, the indicator methodology offers a progressive monitoring approach allowing countries to start with reporting based on their existing capacity and progressively enhance the data coverage and indicator significance with increasing capacity.Level 1 monitoring includes a set of general, easily measurable, physico-chemical water quality parameters that can indicate water quality degradation. They can be used to assess the quality status of water bodies, facilitating global comparability and maintaining a balance between the significance of the indicator and the monitoring requirements for each country. Level 2 monitoring allows countries with enhanced capacities to include additional water quality parameters, such as toxic substances and biological monitoring, as well as more sophisticated quality classification schemes to assess and report on the quality of their water bodies more accurately. Good ambient water quality is essential for protecting aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide, including: the preservation of biodiversity; the protection of human health during recreational use and through the provision of drinking water; the support of human nutrition through the provision of fish and water for irrigation; the enabling of a variety of economic activities; and the strengthening of the resilience of people against water-related disasters. Good ambient water quality is therefore closely linked to the achievement of many other Sustainable Development Goals.Target 6.3 aims at improving water quality and indicator 6.3.2 provides a mechanism for determining whether, and to which extent, water quality management measures are contributing to the improvement of water quality over time. The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.1 on wastewater treatment because inadequate wastewater treatment leads to degradation in quality of the waters receiving the wastewater effluents. It directly informs progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on water-related ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal eutrophication).The methodology recognises that countries have different capacity levels to monitor water quality, with many developed countries operating extensive and complex programmes that collect and report data to existing reporting frameworks beyond the scope of this methodology. For these countries it is recognised that this methodology will not contribute to improving their water quality; however it must be sufficiently flexible to capture data from existing monitoring frameworks without burdening countries with additional reporting obligations. Conversely, many of the least developed countries currently do not monitor water quality or operate very limited monitoring programmes. The methodology must therefore allow these countries to contribute to the global indicator, according to their national capacity and available resources. The development of the methodology builds on best practice for water quality monitoring promoted by the UN Environment GEMS/Water programme since 1978 together with testing by several pilot countries during the Integrated Monitoring Initiative Proof of Concept phase of 2016, and external review by experts and international organizations. This led to revision of the original methodology, which was then further tested through the 2017 global data drive. The feedback received has contributed to the present refined methodology. Data sources:The recommended sources of data are water quality monitoring data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters in national or sub-national ambient water quality monitoring programmes implemented by governmental authorities. Additional water quality monitoring data from research or citizen-science monitoring programmes can be used to supplement the available authoritative monitoring data, provided they are authorised by the national reporting agency.The number of monitoring locations required to determine the quality status of a water body depends on the type and size of the water body, but a minimum of one monitoring location per water body is required. The minimum data requirements for calculating this indicator are measurements for all of the recommended or alternative core parameters appropriate to the type of water body as defined in the methodology. Measurements should be taken routinely, at prescribed intervals, or the same time of year each year, from the same locations. Even if new monitoring stations are introduced, data should continue to be collected from the original locations. This ensures that results are comparable between reports, thereby enabling trends to be established over time. The monitoring data needed for the indicator computation may be collected by different monitoring programmes involving different agencies and organizations. It is therefore important to establish and maintain centralized data repositories at the national level that collate the data from the various stakeholders, ensuring compatibility in reporting units between all agencies submitting data. Data should be compiled for each core parameter at each sampling location in order to calculate the indicator.   Collection process:The data will be collected by UN Environment and its Global Environment Monitoring System for Water (GEMS/Water) through electronic reporting in the global water quality information system GEMStat. At the national level, data reports will be provided by the GEMS/Water National Focal Points or any other official counterpart appointed by the respective government. GEMS/Water offers consultation and support in selecting and compiling the required monitoring data, defining suitable river basin districts and delineating water bodies, as well as computing the indicator, upon request through its helpdesk.

"SDG_EN_H2O_WBAMBQ","Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality (%) The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. Aquifer Geological formation capable of storing, transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of water. Classification of water quality If at least 80% of the monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a water body comply with their respective target values, the water body is classified as having a 'good' water quality status. Each water body is classified as being of 'good' or 'not good' status. Groundwater Subsurface water occupying the saturated zone. The indicator is computed by first classifying all assessed water bodies based on the compliance of the monitoring data collected for selected parameters at monitoring locations within the water body with parameter-specific target values:Cwq = (nc / nm) * 100Where  Cwq is the percentage compliance [%];  nc is the number of monitoring values in compliance with the target values;  nm is the total number of monitoring values.A threshold value of 80% compliance is defined to classify water bodies as 'good' quality. Thus, a body of water is classified as having a good quality status if at least 80% of all monitoring data from all monitoring stations within the water body are in compliance with the respective targets.In a second step, the classification results are used to compute the indicator as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having a good quality status to the total number of classified water bodies expressed in percentage:WBGQ = (ng / nt) * 100Where  WBGQ is the percentage of water bodies classified as having a good quality status;  ng is the number of classified water bodies classified as having a good quality status;  nc is the total number of monitored and classified water bodies. The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 6.3.2 requires considerable national financial and human capacities to regularly measure water quality parameters at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions, and to consistently collect, quality-assure and process the monitoring data to compute the indicator. Substantial investments in monitoring and data management infrastructures, as well as targeted capacity development in water quality monitoring programme design and operation, will be required in many countries to enhance national capacities to regularly and consistently report on the indicator. Recognizing the differences in monitoring and data processing capacities among countries, the indicator methodology offers a progressive monitoring approach allowing countries to start with reporting based on their existing capacity and progressively enhance the data coverage and indicator significance with increasing capacity.Level 1 monitoring includes a set of general, easily measurable, physico-chemical water quality parameters that can indicate water quality degradation. They can be used to assess the quality status of water bodies, facilitating global comparability and maintaining a balance between the significance of the indicator and the monitoring requirements for each country. Level 2 monitoring allows countries with enhanced capacities to include additional water quality parameters, such as toxic substances and biological monitoring, as well as more sophisticated quality classification schemes to assess and report on the quality of their water bodies more accurately. Good ambient water quality is essential for protecting aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide, including: the preservation of biodiversity; the protection of human health during recreational use and through the provision of drinking water; the support of human nutrition through the provision of fish and water for irrigation; the enabling of a variety of economic activities; and the strengthening of the resilience of people against water-related disasters. Good ambient water quality is therefore closely linked to the achievement of many other Sustainable Development Goals.Target 6.3 aims at improving water quality and indicator 6.3.2 provides a mechanism for determining whether, and to which extent, water quality management measures are contributing to the improvement of water quality over time. The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.1 on wastewater treatment because inadequate wastewater treatment leads to degradation in quality of the waters receiving the wastewater effluents. It directly informs progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on water-related ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal eutrophication).The methodology recognises that countries have different capacity levels to monitor water quality, with many developed countries operating extensive and complex programmes that collect and report data to existing reporting frameworks beyond the scope of this methodology. For these countries it is recognised that this methodology will not contribute to improving their water quality; however it must be sufficiently flexible to capture data from existing monitoring frameworks without burdening countries with additional reporting obligations. Conversely, many of the least developed countries currently do not monitor water quality or operate very limited monitoring programmes. The methodology must therefore allow these countries to contribute to the global indicator, according to their national capacity and available resources. The development of the methodology builds on best practice for water quality monitoring promoted by the UN Environment GEMS/Water programme since 1978 together with testing by several pilot countries during the Integrated Monitoring Initiative Proof of Concept phase of 2016, and external review by experts and international organizations. This led to revision of the original methodology, which was then further tested through the 2017 global data drive. The feedback received has contributed to the present refined methodology. Data sources:The recommended sources of data are water quality monitoring data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters in national or sub-national ambient water quality monitoring programmes implemented by governmental authorities. Additional water quality monitoring data from research or citizen-science monitoring programmes can be used to supplement the available authoritative monitoring data, provided they are authorised by the national reporting agency.The number of monitoring locations required to determine the quality status of a water body depends on the type and size of the water body, but a minimum of one monitoring location per water body is required. The minimum data requirements for calculating this indicator are measurements for all of the recommended or alternative core parameters appropriate to the type of water body as defined in the methodology. Measurements should be taken routinely, at prescribed intervals, or the same time of year each year, from the same locations. Even if new monitoring stations are introduced, data should continue to be collected from the original locations. This ensures that results are comparable between reports, thereby enabling trends to be established over time. The monitoring data needed for the indicator computation may be collected by different monitoring programmes involving different agencies and organizations. It is therefore important to establish and maintain centralized data repositories at the national level that collate the data from the various stakeholders, ensuring compatibility in reporting units between all agencies submitting data. Data should be compiled for each core parameter at each sampling location in order to calculate the indicator.   Collection process:The data will be collected by UN Environment and its Global Environment Monitoring System for Water (GEMS/Water) through electronic reporting in the global water quality information system GEMStat. At the national level, data reports will be provided by the GEMS/Water National Focal Points or any other official counterpart appointed by the respective government. GEMS/Water offers consultation and support in selecting and compiling the required monitoring data, defining suitable river basin districts and delineating water bodies, as well as computing the indicator, upon request through its helpdesk. Data reported by the countries will be checked for consistency with respect to the monitoring parameters, target values and spatial units and compared with monitoring data available in GEMStat, if applicable.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer.

To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries.

Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.

For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. To address its complexity, Indicator 6.6.1 has been divided into 5 Sub-Indicators to capture the various data sources and methodologies required for monitoring components of the Indicator. Data sources come from a combination of ground sampling and earth observations. Depending on the type of ecosystem and the type of extent being measured, the data collection methodology can also differ greatly. A progressive monitoring approach with two levels is proposed:Level 1: 2 Sub-Indicators based on globally available data from earth observations which will be validated by countries against their own methodologies and datasets: - Sub-Indicator 1 - spatial extent of water-related ecosystems - Sub-Indicator 2 - water quality of lakes and artificial water bodiesLevel 2: Data collected by countries through 3 Sub-Indicators:- Sub-Indicator 3 - quantity of water (discharge) in rivers and estuaries- Sub-Indicator 4 - water quality imported from SDG Indicator 6.3.2 - Sub-Indicator 5 - quantity of groundwater within aquifersA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, 'Monitoring Methodology for SDG Indicator 6.6.1'. Water-related ecosystems Water-related ecosystems - includes five categories: 1) vegetated wetlands, 2) rivers and estuaries, 3) lakes, 4) aquifers, and 5) artificial waterbodies. For purposes of this methodology, the text refers only to these five ecosystem category terminologies. The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

The majority of water-related ecosystem types monitored in Indicator 6.6.1 contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves and estuaries which contain brackish waters and are included in Indicator 6.6.1. Ecosystems containing or within salt waters are not included as these are covered within other SDG indicators (Goal 14). Other categories of wetlands aligning with the Ramsar Convention definitions are captured within the ecosystem category of 'vegetated wetlands'. Vegetated Wetlands Vegetated Wetlands - the water-related ecosystem category of vegetated wetlands includes swamps, fens, peatlands, marshes, paddies, and mangroves. This definition is closely related to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands definition of wetlands, which is: 'areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres' with the exception that salt waters are not included in Indicator 6.6.1 reporting (as they are covered in SDG 14) and with the exception that vegetated wetlands are distinct from the other ecosystem categories of lakes, rivers and estuaries, aquifers, and artificial waterbodies. Vegetated wetlands have been separated as their own ecosystem category because of their importance for target achievement and because the methodology for monitoring them with earth observations is unique from other open waters. The data generated by applying this methodology will also generate data required by countries to report to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Artificial Waterbodies Artificial Waterbodies - the water-related ecosystem category of artificial waterbodies includes open waterbodies created by humans such as reservoirs, canals, harbors, mines and quarries. While it is recognized that these are not traditional water ecosystems which should be protected and restored, in some countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. The 5 Sub-Indicators are computed separately and thus Indicator 6.6.1 is comprised of 5 stand-alone methodologies. Sub-Indicator 1: Spatial Extent of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into a global spatial extent of water-related ecosystems dataset. The basic premise of this approach is that different land covers, such as snow, bare rock, vegetation, and water, reflect different wavelengths of light. Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

Satellites continually circulate our earth, capturing images and wavelengths reflected from every location on the globe. For any one location on earth, thousands of images can be combined to classify the site's land cover. Advanced computing technology can be programmed to digest all of these images and split the earth into land cover type pixels, one of which is open water. Open water is defined as any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. Thus, changes in the spatial extent of open water locations over a long period of time can be discerned including new and lost waterbodies or seasonal changes. To distinguish one water-related ecosystem type from another, further processing of this open water data is required in conjunction with other datasets. The data generated on open water is further distinguished into lakes, rivers and estuaries versus artificial waterbodies. In addition, vegetated wetlands are discerned through further processing. The method to detect vegetated wetlands from Earth observations is based on an approach which detects the physical properties of wetland areas (e.g. soil moisture and vegetation water content) from multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical satellite imagery, combined with other geospatial datasets related to the topography of the area, the hydrography of the watershed and its drainage network, and the soil types. The resulting datasets obtained from earth observations on the spatial extent of vegetated wetlands and artificial waterbodies are excluded from the calculation of spatial extent values for lakes, rivers and estuaries, to prevent duplication of spatial extent estimations. Thus, three global datasets are generated through this methodology annually: spatial extent of lakes, rivers, and estuaries; spatial extent of artificial waterbodies; and spatial extent of vegetated wetlands. These national spatial extent datasets are provided to countries to validate. Once validated, the annual datasets are used to calculate percentage change of spatial extent over time, using a 2001-2005 baseline period. Subsequent five year averages are compared to this baseline.Percentage change in spatial extent = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = the average national spatial extent from 2001-2005G = the average national spatial extent of any other 5 year periodSub-Indicator 2: Water Quality of Lakes and artificial water bodiesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes how Earth observations are generated and processed into two datasets of chlorophyll a (Chl) and total suspended solids (TSS) within lakes globally. Earth observations can only provide information on concentrations of in-water materials that affect the colour of water. These materials include Chl, which is the primary pigment in phytoplankton (the primary source of food on the food-chain), and TSS. The concentrations of Chl and TSS can be used as proxies to infer other important waterbody characteristics.Chl and TSS results are derived using empirical algorithms, generated for each individual pixel to ensure the spatial variability within each lake is fully captured. Results are averaged over a year for each lake to produce lake-wide Chl and TSS concentrations and small localized fluctuations in concentration of these two parameters are not shown. On any one day, the pixels representing each concentration of Chl or TSS are quantified and a lake-wide average is determined for that day. The change in concentration of both Chl and TSS can be determined from comparing an annual average against the baseline. This annual average Chl and TSS will be averaged every 5 years, which will be compared to the Chl and TSS baselines to generate a percentage change. The locations where percentage change is excessive can be targeted for increased water quality monitoring and management. Sub-Indicator 3: Quantity (Discharge) of Water in Rivers and EstuariesThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes different techniques for countries to implement to monitor river and estuary discharge. These techniques can include gauging stations or discharge meters. The methodology does not prescribe the type of discharge measurement technique because selection should be based on the size and type of the waterbody, terrain and velocity of water flow, the desired accuracy of measurement, as well as finances available. However, any discharge data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Discharge data from each river/estuary monitored should be collected at least once per month. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average discharge per river/estuary monitored. - Each basin should have at minimum of one sampling location, at the point where its water exits into another basin or crosses a national boundary. Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average discharges per basin to the custodian agencies. The data from these 5 years will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of discharge for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in discharge for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference dischargeG = the average discharge of 5 year period of interestSub-Indicator 4: Quality of Water-related EcosystemsThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator is described in SDG Indicator 6.3.2. The data collected for Indicator 6.3.2 is utilized for Sub-Indicator 4 to inform a calculation of percentage change over time in waterbodies with good ambient water quality. Sub-Indicator 5: Quantity of Groundwater within AquifersThe methodology for this Sub-Indicator describes a simplified technique for countries to monitor groundwater quantity within aquifers. The volume of groundwater stored in an aquifer is most traditionally estimated using a combination of parameters but for the purposes of Indicator 6.6.1 monitoring, the 'head' or level of groundwater within an aquifer can solely be measured as a proxy for groundwater volume within an aquifer. Measuring the level of groundwater within an aquifer is done through the use of boreholes. The methodology does not prescribe the number of boreholes to be monitored per aquifer because the distribution of groundwater can be variable depending on the location and characteristics of aquifers. However, any groundwater level data collected by countries must adhere to the following minimum criteria:- Point measurements of groundwater level within aquifers should be collected at least twice per year. This data should then be averaged to obtain an annual average groundwater level per aquifer monitored. Understanding the seasonal and other short term changes is a necessary aspect of management of groundwater but should only be considered as part of the local management of the groundwater.- Each aquifer monitored should have at minimum one borehole that can be used for groundwater level measurements.Countries will submit 5 years of data on annual average groundwater level per basin to the custodian agencies, which will be averaged to smooth short-term variability. To generate national percentage change of discharge over time, a common reference period for all basins must be established. This baseline period will be used to calculate percentage change of groundwater quantity for any subsequent 5-year period. To calculate percentage change in quantity for each five year period following the reference period, the following formula is used:Percentage change in discharge = ((B - G) / B) * 100whereB = historical 5 year reference groundwater levelG = the average groundwater level of 5 year period of interest This methodology mobilizes the collection of widely available earth observation data on spatial extent and some water quality parameters which will be validated by countries. The data itself in the form of images and numbers is straightforward to understand. However, the methodologies used to generate this data are technical in nature and some countries may wish understand these better. The methodology employs internationally recognized methods, from expert communities such as the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and international space agencies, to derive statistically sound and the most technologically advanced earth observation datasets for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2. These organizations will also be engaged to provided tools and training to support countries. Sub-Indicator 2 only measures two water quality parameters, while it is recognized that to determine good water quality requires measuring multiple parameters. However, globally available data can indicate potential hot spots of pollution or human disturbance allowing countries to undertake more local assessments of water quality.The Indicator is designed in a way to generate data to allow informed decision making towards protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. It does not measure how many water-related ecosystems have been protected and restored. It is assumed that countries would use the data to actively make decisions, but these actions are not currently being measured. The data generated should be considered alongside other data such as land use change to enable decision-makers to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Target 6.6 aims to 'protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes' through Indicator 6.6.1 which aims to understand how and why these ecosystems are changing in extent over time. All of the different components of Indicator 6.6.1 are important to form a comprehensive picture that enables informed decisions towards the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. However, a lack of data within countries to support Indicator 6.6.1 has become clear through the 2017 pilot testing and thus a combination of national data and data based on satellite images is proposed. All data generated is processed using internationally recognized methodologies, resulting in high quality global datasets with extensive spatial and temporal scale. Data sources:Sub-Indicator 1: Open water spatial extent data, acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites at a 30 m resolution, has been generated for the entire globe from 2001-2015. From 2016 onwards (up to and including 2030), higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites, including both optical and radar satellites, will be used. For example, 20 m Sentinel 1 (radar) and 10 m Sentinel 2 (optical) satellites, used in combination with Landsat satellites, will allow for a more precise delineation of water bodies both in spatial terms (due to the higher spatial resolution) and in temporal terms (due to the higher revisit time). Additional datasets will be used refine open water spatial extent data, including the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) geospatial database. To generate spatial extent of vegetated wetlands, a combination of imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 and 2 will be used. This will be augmented by other existing global datasets such as the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) annual mangrove maps, as well as the most locally-adapted geospatial datasets capturing topography, hydrography, drainage networks, and soil types.  Sub-Indicator 2: Chl and TSS lake observations are obtained from combined Landsat and Sentinel satellites paired with instruments like OLCI, MODIS, and VIIRS. The sensor instruments used to detect TSS and Chl determine the spatial resolution of water quality within lakes which can be detected. Some of the more accurate water quality sensors have 250-350 meter resolution, while less accurate sensors can detect TSS and Chl changes to 100 m resolution.  Sub-Indicator 3: The source of data for monitoring discharge for this Sub-Indicator is primarily from ground in situ measurements within rivers and estuaries, though modelled data is also acceptable. Sub-Indicator 4: The source of data for monitoring water quality for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements within water-related ecosystems. Sub-Indicator 5: The source of data for monitoring groundwater quantity for this Sub-Indicator is from ground in situ measurements of groundwater level within aquifers, though modelled data is also acceptable.    Collection process:Sub-Indicators 1 and 2: All globally available data generated for Sub-Indicators 1 and 2 is shared with countries for validation. This geospatial data will be generated annually at national, sub-national, and waterbody scales. While this data is generated annually, the measurement to report change in extent requires validation every five years. Validated annual datasets will be utilized by the custodian agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of countries. Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5: All data collected within countries for Sub-Indicators 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted to the custodian agencies for review and quality assurance checks against the methodology minimum criteria. This review process will be facilitated via email communication through the global help desk. Once annual 'raw' data is reviewed, percentage change calculations will be completed and validated between the custodian agencies and the national representative.

"SDG_SH_HAP_HBSAG","Prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (%) This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).       Hepatitis B surface antigen: a protein from the virus's coat. A positive test for HBsAg indicates active HBV infection. The immune response to HBsAg provides the basis for immunity against HBV, and HBsAg is the main component of HepB.     The data was modelled using a Bayesian logistic regression looking at the proportion of individuals that tested positive for HBsAg in each study, weighting each study by its size and using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model accounting for spatial and economic correlations between similar countries. This model uses data from well sampled countries to estimate prevalence in more data poor countries with effects such as sex, age and vaccination status, these are also informed by the geographic and countries GDP proximity to other countries (CAR model). Under the assumption that countries that are close together economically and/or geographically will have more similar prevalence due to similar social structure and health care capabilities.              The response variable in the model was the prevalence of Hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) with the explanatory variables being age (three categories, under 5, juvenile (5-15) and adult (16+), split using the average age of participants in the study), sex (proportion female in the study), study bias (e.g. a high fraction of study participants from indigenous populations), 3 dose vaccine coverage, birth dose of the vaccine and country of study. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. The WHO-UNICEF estimates are annual data for the country as a whole, and did not contain information on vaccine efficacy which was not used in the analysis as no data on this was obtained. The vaccine efficacy would be implicitly estimated in the analysis as we see vaccination having a variable effect across time and space across the studies. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. The coverage of routine 3 dose vaccination and birth dose vaccination in each study was calculated by cross referencing the year of and age of participants in each study with the corresponding WHO-UNICEF vaccine coverage estimates for that country. More explicitly, the model uses the ages and timing of the study to calculate the years across which the participants are born, so if the if there was an age group range of 10-15 in a study that was undertaken in 2015, the birth years would be from 2000-2005, we then average the vaccination coverage from the WHO-UNICEF estimates across those 5 years assuming that each age was evenly represented in that age group in the study. The same process was used for the 3 dose and birth dose vaccination.      (see formula of the general logistic model in https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-03-04.pdf).            The model was simulated in the Bayesian statistical package WinBUGS, and data manipulation and model initialisation run from R (3.3.1) using R2WinBUGS. The model considers the parameters of age, sex, study bias (e.g. a high fraction of study participants from indigenous populations), vaccine coverage, birth dose of the vaccine and country of study.             The model uses the CAR-normal function, in WinBUGS, to model the spatial and economic autocorrelation related to neighbouring countries. For each country that had prevalence data, a weighted central position was calculated using the size and location of each study. For those countries with no data, we used the population centroid. In a novel approach, we considered 3 dimensions in the country adjacency matrix; we used the usual geographic dimensions, latitude and longitude and also combined these with the natural log of the country's GDP per capita. This was to measure not only geographic but also the developmental proximity of countries. The adjacency matrix for the geo-economic distance gives a score between each country to every other country. Those countries which are close geographically and economically would have a low score and those further apart either geographically or economically would have a high score/distance. Therefore, those countries that are more alike will have a low score and those countries which are alike would have a high score.             The way we proportioned the geographic and economic distance to produce the adjacency matrix was then explored, this is because geographic distance may be more or less important than economic similarities. Thus, by creating a number of different adjacency matrices (not definitive) we could select the most suitable matrix that explains reality best. We normalised the geographic and GDP distance and then calculated the distance between these two normalised figures. This creates a smoothed Gaussian surface that is dependent on both spatial proximity and GDP per-capita proximity. We compared ratios of, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2 (Geographic:GDP).             For each different adjacency matrix, we also had to select a neighbourhood distance, i.e. over what distance can a country be effected by another. Thus, we also varied the radius of distance from which to select neighbours for the neighbourhood network, we used the maximum minimum distance, twice the maximum minimum and three times the maximum minimum, thus varying the number of neighbours each country would have.             Finally, to decide the magnitude of the effect one country has on another in the neighbourhood network we varied the weights of pairs of countries in the adjacency matrix, using either a neutral weighting of 1, so that each neighbour has an equal effect on each other (not dependent on the distance in the network), or decaying weights over distance with 1/distance, and 1/distance2, where the closer the country is the greater the effect it has on another country. The outcome of these 36 different combinations led to minimum DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) being found for a ratio of 1:2 (Geographic:GDP), the neighbourhood networks minimum distance being twice the maximum minimum distance and an even weighting of 1/distance for each adjacent country.             This model structure produces estimates for all fixed effects and also individual country level risk, this provides information on which are significantly at greater or lower risk to the average risk.              All parameters were given un-informative priors. Simulations were run with 3 MCMC chains with 50,000 burn in iterations and each parameter estimated from 1000 samples taken from a thinned 250,000 iterations to produce the posterior distribution. Convergence was attained, with rÌ<U+0082> values all very close to 1.000. Due to the Bayesian framework and WinBUGS software it was possible to gain estimates for countries where we had no data on prevalence, using their GDP and geographic proximity to inform this estimate. Those countries with the largest number of studies provided the estimates with the tightest confidence intervals and those with few or no data were less well defined, often producing a log normal distributed posterior distribution, giving estimates with long tails.             Posterior distributions of parameters were inspected for convergence and to check for covariance between parameters.  Where necessary parameters were centred and scaled to N (0, 1) to aid parameter convergence and remover covariance. This was done for the sex parameter, which was entered as the proportion of the sample that was female; this was seen to co-vary with the intercept and bias parameters before re-centring and scaling. However, the covariance of routine vaccination and birth dose persisted even after re-centring. This is in part unsurprising as there a few instances where birth dose is administered without the routine vaccination. Here we tried to reduce this interaction of the terms by transforming the birth dose data. We modelled birth dose using only data where the birth dose was greater than 60, 70, 80 & 90% respectively, we also modelled birth dose to the square, thus increasing the effect of high birth doses over smaller doses. Model selection dependent on which one both reduced the covariance between the parameters and returned the lowest DIC score.             Model validation was conducted using 90% of randomly selected data against the remaining 10%, and by comparing model estimates of prevalence against observed data (Figure 3).  The main Limitations of the analysis is that despite the thorough and in-depth literature search and access, there are fewer data on post vaccination studies than pre- vaccination studies. The model is largely informed by pre-vaccination studies in adults.      The quality of studies and data was assessed by reviewing representativeness of sampling. Bias factor is a dichotomous variable.      Potential important biases included geographical representation of the data points.  Also, studies were from many different sources such as blood donors and pregnant women. The former possibly having a lower proportion of Hep B prevalence than the general population as donor questionnaires often exclude individuals with risk factors for blood-borne diseases and the pregnant women possibly having a higher prevalence as were in studies to see the effect of a birth dose of vaccine to prevent vertical transmission. As the proportion of studies and size of studies that were from blood donors was significantly greater than those on pregnant women, we may presume that our estimates of prevalence of pre- vaccination may be on the low side. The purpose is to describe the reduction in chronic hepatitis b infections. Most of the burden of disease from HBV infection comes from infections acquired before the age of 5 years. Therefore, prevention of HBV infection focuses on children under 5 years of age. The United Nations selected the cumulative incidence of chronic HBV infection at 5 years of age as an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goal target for 'combating hepatitis'. This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Data sources: A systematic search on articles published between Jan 1, 1965, and Oct 30, 2018. in the databases Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Popline, and Web of Science.             Following full text review, we extracted data from each study using the following variables: study characteristics (study and sample collection dates, study locations i.e., city, subnational [an area, region, state, or province in a country], or national level), participant characteristics (age range, sex, year, and population group), and prevalence of the HBV marker, type of laboratory tests, and number of participants the HBV marker prevalence was based on.      Data of eligible articles were entered into a Microsoft EXCEL and/or Distiller databank by two reviewers independently. Information was extracted for author name, year, age, gender, marker, laboratory test used, number of individuals tested, prevalence of each marker when reported, the population group (general population, HCWs, or blood donors) and whether the data reported was for a city, sub-national (an area, region, state or province in a country) or national level, GDP per capita. In addition to HBsAg, HBeAg was recorded, as available for individuals when HBsAg was also reported. In order to record information on methodological quality and study bias resulting from non-representativeness, an additional variable was used: samples likely to be representative for the country/area specified were coded as 0 and others, e.g. convenience samples in certain communities or tribes in the country were assigned a 1, supplemented by additional information. The risk of bias/non-representativeness information was applied if the population was neither HCW nor blood donor (see description below).  In the following, variables extracted from the studies and assumptions made are described in detail:      1.	Author, Date      2.	Year start/end of study conduct: Year of study begin and end was extracted. If this information was not available from the studies, we used the commonly used assumption that the study was conducted two years prior to the year of publication (e.g. author, 2000, year of study conduct: 1998).       3.	Sex: Sex-specific values were extracted. If only an overall (all) estimate was provided, the share of females in the study was specified in the column additional information.      4.	Age start/end: The most specific age-group provided by the data was extracted. If the age-group on which the parameter value was based on was not available, assumptions were made based on the context of the study. Therefore, the following was applied in case of missing information on age-groups in the study population:       a.	If the study was conducted in the general population without further specification and if only one prevalence estimate is provided, the age-group was considered to be 0-85 years. Subsequently, if the beginning and last age-group is missing, the lower value of the youngest age-group is 1 year, the upper value of the oldest age-groups is 85 years.       b.	If the study was conducted among adult populations but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 17-65 years.       c.	If the study was conducted among pupils but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 5-15 years.       d.	If the study was conducted among pregnant women but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 15-49 years (reproductive age).       e.	If the study was conducted among blood donors but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 17-65 years.       f.	If the study was conducted among army recruits or soldiers but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 18-45 years.       g.	If the study was conducted among the working population but no age-range is provided, the age-group is considered to be 16-65 years.       5.	HBsAg Prevalence: The most specific prevalence estimate provided by the data was extracted (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence). Separate lines for each marker were used in the data extraction file (e.g. one for HBeAg and one line for HBsAg, even if the study group/publication was the same)      6.	HBeAg Prevalence (optional marker): The most specific prevalence estimate (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence) of HBeAg among HBsAg-positive individuals was extracted and, if applicable was calculated to reflect prevalence among HBsAg carriers.       7.	anti-HBc Prevalence (optional marker): The most specific prevalence estimate provided by the data was extracted (defined by age-/sex-/year-prevalence).      8.	Laboratory method: Testing immune response markers of HBV infection began in the 1970s by counter-immuno-electrophoresis technique (CIEP). Since then, different detection methods have been developed (RIA, EIA, â<U+0080>¦). The most applied method in prevalence studies is the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Five categories were established to record the method/test used for prevalence detection in the studies: ELI new (ELISA -2, -3, EIA, â<U+0080>¦), EIA old (CMIA, CIEP, RPHA), NAT (qPCR/real-time PCR, nested PCR, multiplex PCR), other (e.g. RIA); Unknown/not specified.      9.	Country: Country names were recorded according to www.who.int and, for additional analysis purpose, were grouped according to the six WHO regions: the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the European Region, the South East-Asia Region and the Western Pacific Region.      10.	Sample size of individuals blood drawn from; of individuals involved in analyses/bases for parameter estimate: As a quality indicator of the study, we distinguished the effective sample size, i.e. the number of individuals involved in the analysis/on which the parameter estimate is based on, from the number of individuals from which blood was drawn from (separate column) and the initially calculated/planed sample size (separate column).       11.	Population: Although focus was on the general population, two additional groups were included and specified. These include: HCW and blood donor (plus subgroups unspecified, paid, unpaid/voluntary). If in this column 'population' was specified as HCW or blood donor and not as general population, the risk of bias column (following) remains empty.      12.	Level: Information is provided if the study was conducted on a national, sub-national, city level or if the level was not further specified (four categories).      13.	Study Location: This free-text variable specifies the city/area within the country where the included study was conducted. The variables/columns Level and Study Location were additionally included following the WHO Meeting on Impact of Hepatitis B Vaccination at WHO, Geneva, in March 2014.            Additional data from other sources than the eligible studies:      1.	Year of vaccine introduction in the entire country:  data is derived from official reports by WHO Member States and unless otherwise stated, data is reported annually through the WHO/UNICEF joint reporting process. http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/year_vaccine_introduction.xls?ua=1      2.	Period when the study was conducted: pre- vaccination or post vaccination. This is determined according the year of introduction in the whole country.       3.	Coverage estimates series: data is obtained from WUENIC: http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragebcg.html       4.	GDP per capita was used form UN data that compiles information from the World Bank Source http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=GDP&d=SNAAMA&f=grID%3a101%3bcurrID%3aUSD%3bpcFlag%3a1 ),       5.	Longitude and latitude data (source: www.google.com).      6.	Population structure and size data for each country was from the UN population division: http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/             Collection process: WHO provides Member States the opportunity to review and comment on data as part of the so called country consultation process. Member States receive an annex with their country specific estimates, the serosurveys used to inform the mathematical model and the summary of the methodology. They are provided with sufficient time to provide any additional study to be screened according to the inclusion and inclusion criteria.

"SDG_EN_WWT_WWDS","Proportion of safely treated domestic wastewater flows (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of safely treated domestic wastewater flows (%) This indicator measures the volumes of wastewater which are generated through different activities, and the volumes of wastewater which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of these indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the 'proportion of wastewater flow safely treated'. Wastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the  International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent possible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the environment will be calculated. Wastewater Total wastewater generation and treatment can be quantified at the national level, and wastewater can also be disaggregated into different types of flows, based on ISIC categories. Domestic wastewater generated by private households, as well as wastewater generated by economic activities covered by ISIC categories, may or may not be pre-treated on premises before discharge to either the sewer for further treatment or directly to the environment.               The main sources of wastewater include wastewater from households, services and industries, i.e. point sources of one or more pollutant(s) that can be geographically located and represented as a point on a map. Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can contribute quite significantly to wastewater flows (Figure 1), and therefore its progressive inclusion in the global monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored under indicator 6.3.2 'Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality'. Differentiating between the different wastewater streams is important as policy decisions need to be guided by the polluter pays principle. However, wastewater conveyed by combined sewers usually combines both hazardous and non-hazardous substances discharged from different sources, but also runoff and urban stormwater, which cannot be separately tracked and monitored. As a consequence, although the flow of wastewater generated can be disaggregated by sources (domestic, services industrial), the treated  wastewater statistics are most commonly disaggregated by type (e.g. urban and industrial) and/or level of treatment (e.g. secondary) rather than by sources.Total wastewater flows can be classified into three main categories (see 'disaggregation section' for details:- Industrial (ISIC divisions 05-35)- Services (ISIC divisions 45-96)- Domestic (private households)Wastewater treatment can be classified into three main categories (see 'disaggregation section' for details:- Primary- Secondary- TertiaryWhere possible, treatment will additionally be classified into either on-premises or off-premises treatment. Domestic wastewater: Wastewater from residential settlements which originates predominantly from the human metabolism and from household activities.Industrial (process) wastewater: Water discharged after being used in, or produced by, industrial production processes and which is of no further immediate value to these processes. Where process water recycling systems have been installed, process wastewater is the final discharge from these circuits. To meet quality standards for eventual discharge into public sewers, this process waste-water is understood to be subjected to ex-process in-plant treatment. Cooling water is not considered here. Sanitary wastewater and surface runoff from industries are also excluded here.Total wastewater generated is the total volume of wastewater generated by economic activities (agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; and other economic activities) and households. Cooling water is excluded. Urban wastewater: Domestic wastewater or the mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial wastewater and/or runoff rain water. Wastewater: Wastewater is water which is of no further value to the purpose for which it was used because of its quality, quantity or time of occurrence. Cooling water is not considered here.Wastewater discharge: The amount of water (in m3) or substance (in kg BOD/d or comparable) added/leached to a water body (Fresh or non-fresh) from a point source.Wastewater treatment: Process to render wastewater fit to meet applicable environmental standards or other quality norms for recycling or reuse.NANA The amount of wastewater generated is calculated by summing all of the wastewater generated by different economic activities and households. Wastewater flows are expressed in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion.        The amount of wastewater safely treated is calculated by summing all of the wastewater flows which receive treatment considered equivalent to secondary treatment or better. This wastewater flow is expressed in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion.The proportion of wastewater flows which are safely treated is calculated as a ratio of the amount of wastewater safely treated to the amount of wastewater generated. There is a relative lack of knowledge about the volumes of wastewater generated and treated, because wastewater statistics are in an early stage of development in many countries and not regularly produced or reported. Monitoring is relatively complex, costly, and data are not systematically aggregated to the national level and/or accessible; especially industrial wastewater data which are in general poorly monitored and seldom aggregated at national level.To some extent, this may be explained by the fact that a large proportion of the industrial water requirements are covered by the use of private systems using non-public/drinking water supply (groundwater, rivers and wells) which are not systematically included in the national statistics.Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can contribute significantly to wastewater flows, and therefore its progressive inclusion in the global monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored indirectly under indicator 6.3.2 on the proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality.Different types of wastewater have different degrees of contamination and pose different levels of threat to the environment and public health. Some data exist on the pollutant loading in terms of BOD5 and COD (kg O2/day), but these are not as widely available as data on volumes and will not be used at present for indicator 6.3.1. It is anticipated that future data drives will include more information on pollutant loadings that could be eventually featured in SDG 6.3.1 reporting. Finally, whether wastewater is classified as safely treated or not depends on the wastewater treatment plant's compliance rate to the effluent standards (i.e. performance). Many wastewater plants produce effluent which does not meet quality standards, due to improper design or loading. Effluent standards rely on both national and local requirements, as well as on specific water uses and potential reuse options, so that this approach may not provide strictly comparable variables between countries. For the purposes of global monitoring, in the absence of data on compliance, technology-based proxies will be used, in which compliance is assumed if the treatment plant provides at least secondary treatment. Wastewater data are crucial to promote strategies for sustainable and safe wastewater use or reuse to the benefit of the world's population health and the global environment, but also to respond to growing water demands, increasing water pollution loads, and climate change impacts on water resources.Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is about ensuring the availability and sustainability of water and sanitation for all by 2030. SDG Target 6.3 sets out to improve ambient water quality, which is essential to protecting both ecosystem and human health, by eliminating, minimizing and significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies.The purpose of monitoring progress using SDG indicator 6.3.1 is to provide necessary and timely information to decision makers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to accelerate progress towards reducing water pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and increasing wastewater treatment and reuse. The target wording covers wastewater recycling and safe reuse with implication on water use efficiency, although it is not fully addressed by the global indicator and methodology.SDG indicator 6.3.1 tracks the proportion of wastewater flows from households, services and industrial economic activities that are safely treated at the source or through centralized wastewater treatment plants before being discharged into the environment, out of the total volume of wastewater generated. Data sources:A clear specification of the terminology and methodology for wastewater statistics is essential to contribute to harmonising international data collection practices and SDG 6.3.1 reporting. The objective of indicator 6.3.1 is to cover households and the entire economy, and to build on the existing international methodology for global monitoring wastewater generation and treatment. This approach reduces the monitoring burden that SDG reporting can impose on countries, and provides well-defined and internationally comparable variables for global data analysis and use by policymakers and urban/land planners.Data are extracted from a number of pre-existing sources: - Indicator tables from the UNSD/UNEP data collection on environment statisticshttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators (refer to 'Inland Water Resources')- Country files from the UNSD/UNEP data collection on environment statistics (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/country_files) - Website of Eurostat water statistics (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water) - Website of OECD water statistics (https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=water_treat#).- Country files from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) data collection on safely managed sanitation services, and the reports referenced therein(https://washdata.org/)Collection process:Total flows of wastewater generated and treated are reported by countries to UNSD and OECD/Eurostat databases. Eurostat deals with Member States of the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) as well as the respective candidate countries. OECD works with all its Member States not contacted by Eurostat. UNSD sends the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire to the rest of the world (approx. 165 countries). However, the response rate for the UNSD/UNEP questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, especially for developing countries. While efforts will continue to collect data from National Statistical Offices and Ministries of Environment at the national level, it is also critical to improve the availability and accessibility of wastewater statistics and increase training for collection of data and capacity development at the national and sub-national levels.The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) collects and compiles national data related to use of sanitation services including wastewater treatment, for calculation of SDG indicator 6.2.1a 'proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services.' National data sources are collected from National Statistical Offices, ministries responsible for service delivery, and regulatory authorities, as well as other regional and global initiatives (e.g. the European Protocol on Water and Health). The database is updated every two years following a country consultation process facilitated by WHO and UNICEF regional offices. These databases rely on a comparable harmonized terminology for water statistics. Wastewater data are nonetheless still relatively sparse on a global scale. UN-Habitat and WHO will disseminate information about these data collection processes, and will liaise with their technical focal points in regions and countries, to work with them to produce estimates which could then feed into the official statistical system via the NSOs. It is expected that over time, a better reporting of the wastewater data collected can be made to populate the SDG Indicator 6.3.1. Indicator release: 2020.Q4.G.02 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 6 goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources. Achieving this Goal, which is critical to the survival of people and the planet, means expanding international cooperation and garnering the support of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally  Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated NANA NANA NANA NANA NANA NANA NANA NANA NANA "

Only women who provide a 'yes' answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health.Women's autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from responses to the following three questions:1.

Denominator: Total number women aged 15-49 years old, who are married or in union. Proportion = (Numerator/Denominator) * 100 Until recently, the indicator captured results for married and in-union women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are using any type of contraception. In the phase of the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS-7) and later rounds, the questionnaire are extended to respondents whether they are using contraception or not. One limitation of the data is that unmarried women and girls are not included.As of early 2020, a total of 57 countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, have at least one survey with data on all three questions necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. Broader data sources are needed and efforts to increase data coverage are underway. Current data on the indicator are mainly derived from the DHS and efforts are being made to include the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the Generation and Gender Survey (GGS) and other country-specific surveys.In many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude the homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups. Women's and girls' autonomy in decision making about sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive use and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights.  Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered empowered to exercise their reproductive rights.Regarding decision-making on use of contraception, a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made 'mainly by the partner', as opposed to decision being made 'by the woman alone' or 'by the woman jointly with the partner'. Depending in the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman 'alone' or 'jointly with the partner' does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. A woman's ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women's empowerment. Data sources:Current data on the indicator are mainly derived from nationally representative DHS.  Data sources increasingly include MICS and GGS, and other country-specific surveys. Collection process:Data is collected in line with the methodology used for the relevant national survey. Relevant country-specific surveysData for SDG indicator 5.6.1 may be collectecd through existing county-specific surveys. For existing national household surveys, it must be ascertained that the sampling design does not systematically exclude subgroups of the population that are important to SDG 5.6.1, specifically, women of reproductive age (15-49) that are currently married or in union. Surveys that cover only certain population subgroups, such as women who speak the dominant language or women from the main ethnic group, may exclude the experiences of a large number of women. Data on the ethnicity and religion of the survey participants should be collected whenever available. The survey should have a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households), be nationally-representative, and representative, at least, at one administrative level below the national level.Surveys on unrelated topics may not be good candidates for the incorporation of the SDG 5.6.1 questions.

Only women who provide a 'yes' answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health.Women's autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from responses to the following three questions:1.	Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself?-	RESPONDENT -	HUSBAND/PARTNER-	RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY-	SOMEONE ELSE-	OTHER SPECIFY 2.	Who usually makes the decision on whether or not you should use contraception?  -	RESPONDENT -	HUSBAND/PARTNER -	RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY-	SOMEONE ELSE-	OTHER SPECIFY3.

Union A union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriage-like relationship.NANA Numerator: Number of married or in union women aged 15-49 years old:-	for whom decision on health care for themselves is not usually made by the husband/partner or someone else; and-	for whom the decision on contraception is not mainly made by the husband/partner; and -	who can say no to sex.Only women who satisfy all three empowerment criteria are included in the numerator.  Denominator: Total number women aged 15-49 years old, who are married or in union. Proportion = (Numerator/Denominator) * 100 Until recently, the indicator captured results for married and in-union women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are using any type of contraception. In the phase of the national Demographic and Health Survey (DHS-7) and later rounds, the questionnaire are extended to respondents whether they are using contraception or not. One limitation of the data is that unmarried women and girls are not included.As of early 2020, a total of 57 countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, have at least one survey with data on all three questions necessary for calculating Indicator 5.6.1. Broader data sources are needed and efforts to increase data coverage are underway. Current data on the indicator are mainly derived from the DHS and efforts are being made to include the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the Generation and Gender Survey (GGS) and other country-specific surveys.In many national contexts, household surveys, which are the main data source for this indicator, exclude the homeless and are likely to under-enumerate linguistic or religious minority groups. Women's and girls' autonomy in decision making about sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive use and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights.  Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered empowered to exercise their reproductive rights.Regarding decision-making on use of contraception, a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective of decisions being made 'mainly by the partner', as opposed to decision being made 'by the woman alone' or 'by the woman jointly with the partner'. Depending in the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman 'alone' or 'jointly with the partner' does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. A woman's ability to say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the concept of sexual autonomy and women's empowerment. Data sources:Current data on the indicator are mainly derived from nationally representative DHS.  Data sources increasingly include MICS and GGS, and other country-specific surveys. Collection process:Data is collected in line with the methodology used for the relevant national survey. Relevant country-specific surveysData for SDG indicator 5.6.1 may be collectecd through existing county-specific surveys. For existing national household surveys, it must be ascertained that the sampling design does not systematically exclude subgroups of the population that are important to SDG 5.6.1, specifically, women of reproductive age (15-49) that are currently married or in union. Surveys that cover only certain population subgroups, such as women who speak the dominant language or women from the main ethnic group, may exclude the experiences of a large number of women. Data on the ethnicity and religion of the survey participants should be collected whenever available. The survey should have a large sample size (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households), be nationally-representative, and representative, at least, at one administrative level below the national level.Surveys on unrelated topics may not be good candidates for the incorporation of the SDG 5.6.1 questions. The sensitivity of the topics addressed in health surveys, in particular, those examining women's health, making them a feasible instrument for incorporating questions on women's experience of decision making in sex relations, use of contraceptive, and health care for themselves.In order to generate data for SDG 5.6.1, all three questions must be included in the survey. The three questiones in the Definition section provides generic questions that can be used in country-specific surveys.  For the first and the second questions, these should include distinct categories for women making decisions herself, and women making decisions jointly with her husband/partner.

The change in the ratio of the value added to the volume of water use, over time.Water Use Efficiency (WUE) is defined as the value added of a given major sector  divided by the volume of water used. Following ISIC 4 coding, sectors are defined as:1.	agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter 'agriculture';2.	mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter 'MIMEC';3.	all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter 'services'.The unit of the indicator is expressed in Value/Volume, commonly USD/m3. Water use water that is received by an industry or households from another industry or is directly abstracted. [SEEA-Water (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.F/100), par. 2.21] Water abstraction water removed from the environment by the economy.

It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. [AQUASTAT Glossary] Water use efficiency is computed as the sum of the three sectors listed above, weighted according to the proportion of water used by each sector over the total use. In formula:        WUE = Awe * Pa + Mwe * PM + Swe * PswhereWUE = Water use efficiencyAwe = Irrigated agriculture water use efficiency [USD/m3]Mwe = MIMEC water use efficiency [USD/m3]Swe = Services water use efficiency [USD/m3]Pa = Proportion of water used by the agricultural sector over the total usePm = Proportion of water used by the MIMEC sector over the total usePs = Proportion of water used by the service sector over the total use       The computing of each sector is described below.Water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is calculated as the agricultural value added per agricultural water use, expressed in USD/m3. In formula:Awe = (GVAa * (1 - Cr)) / Vawhere   Awe =  Irrigated agriculture water use efficiency [USD/m3]   GVAa = Gross value added by agriculture (excluding river and marine fisheries and forestry) [USD]   Cr = Proportion of agricultural GVA produced by rainfed agriculture   Va = Volume of water used by the agricultural sector (including irrigation, livestock and aquaculture) [m3]        The volume of water used by the agricultural sectors (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Agricultural value added in national currency is obtained from national statistics, converted to USD and deflated to the baseline year.Cr can be calculated from the proportion of irrigated land on the total Arable land and Permanent crops (hereinafter 'cultivated land', as follows:Cr = 1 / ( 1 + (Ai / (1-Ai)*0.375) )where   Ai = proportion of irrigated land on the total cultivated land, in decimals   0.375 = generic default ratio between rainfed and irrigated yieldsMore detailed estimations are however possible and encouraged at country level.Water efficiency of the MIMEC sectors (including power production): MIMEC value added per unit of water used for the MIMEC sector, expressed in USD/m3.In formula:Mwe = GVAm / Vmwhere   Mwe =  Industrial water use efficiency [USD/m3]   GVAm = Gross value added by MIMEC (including energy) [USD]   Vm = Volume of water used by MIMEC (including energy) [m3]MIMEC water use (Vm) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). MIMEC value added is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year.Services water supply efficiency is calculated as the service sector value added (ISIC 36-39 and ISIC 45-98) divided by water used for distribution by the water collection, treatment and supply industry (ISIC 36), expressed in USD/m3.In formula:Swe = GVAs / Vswhere   Swe = Services water use efficiency [USD/m3]   GVAs = Gross value added by services [USD]   Vs = Volume of water used by the service sector [m3]   Data on volumes of used and distributed water are collected at country level from the municipal supply utilities records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Services value added is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year.Change in water use efficiency (CWUE) is computed as the ratio of water use efficiency (WUE) in time t minus water use efficiency in time t-1, divided by water use efficiency in time t-1 and multiplied by 100:CWUE = ((WUEt - WUEt-1) / WUEt-1) * 100   It must be noted that computing the indicator in an aggregated manner, i.e. total GDP over total water use, would lead to an overestimation of the indicator. That is due to the fact that, for the agricultural sector, only the value produced under irrigation has to be counted in calculating the indicator. Hence, the sum of the value added of the various sectors used in these formulas is not equivalent to the total GDP of the country. The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done for two main reasons:- To ensure that only runoff water and groundwater (so-called blue water) are considered in computing the indicator;- To eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated. The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. value added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses.The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available.This indicator addresses specifically the target component 'substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors', by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind.The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization of supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly important in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for energy and the indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution networks. Data sources:The data needed for the compilation of the indicator are administrative data collected at country level by the relevant institutions, either technical (for water and irrigation) or economic (for value added).Those data are then compiled by FAO, World Bank, UNSD and other international institutions, harmonized and published in sectoral databases such FAO's AQUASTAT, WB's Databank and UNSD's UNdata.Examples of the questionnaires that can be used include:AQUASTAThttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/index.stm#main http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-guide_eng.pdf SEEA WaterSEEA-Water: https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seeawaterwebversion_final_en.pdf SEEA Central Framework: https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/seea_cf_final_en.pdf  SEEA Technical Note on water (draft)https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/technical_note_water_26_05_2016.pdf IRWShttps://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/irws_en.pdf UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics - Water Sectionhttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/questionnaire.htm http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/qindicators.htm  OECD and Eurostat Joint Questionnaire on Inland Watershttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water Source for GDPUNSD: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp Indicator release: 2020.Q4.G.02 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 6 goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources.

"SDG_AG_FPA_CFPI","Consumer Food Price Index","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Consumer Food Price Index The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period. Food price anomalies (IFPA) The indicator of price anomalies (IFPA) relies on two compound growth rates (CGR's), a quarterly compound growth rate (CQGR) and an annual compound growth rate (CAGR). A CGR is a geometric mean that assumes that a random variable grows at a steady rate, compounded over a specific period of time.               Because it assumes a steady rate of growth the CGR smoothes the effect of volatility of price changes. The CGR is the growth in any random variable from time period tA and tB, raised to the power of one over the length of the period of time being considered. NANA Mathematically the IFPA for a particular year y in month t is calculated as the weighted sum of the quarterly indicator of food price anomalies (QIFPAyt) and the annual indicator of food price anomalies (AIFPAyt). It is appropriate to caution the reader that the indicator is just a guide to understanding market dynamics. As such, one cannot rely on it as the sole element to determine whether a food price in a particular market at a given time is abnormally high or low due to the direct effects of local policies. Results must be weighed with other available information on market fundamentals, macroeconomic context and external shocks. The main challenge in implementing the indicator is data availability and data quality. The calculation of the indicator requires an uninterrupted monthly price series (i.e. if more than 3 consecutive months of data are missing the series may be dropped) of at least 5 years, which include the year being analysed and the 4 preceding years to generate averages and standard deviations. Finally, the indicator is calculated on real price terms to net out the effects of inflation and compare prices in constant money terms over time. However, if food items' contribution to CPI is high, it induces downward bias in food real price - i.e., it underestimates the extent of the price increase (nominal prices or a non-food CPI could be used). The thresholds for the IFPAy are expressed as the normalized difference of the compound growth rate of prices from their historical mean for the predefined period of time. And three ranges are established: 1) a less than half a standard deviation difference from the mean is considered normal; 2) a difference that is half but less than one standard deviation is considered moderately high; 3) a difference from the historical mean that is at least one standard deviation greater than the mean is considered abnormally high.        0.5 =< IFPAy < 1 Moderately high        IFPAy >= 1 Abnormally high        -0.5 =< IFPAy < 0.5 Normal        We use one standard deviation as the relevant threshold since we want to minimize the probability of missing a significant market event. Events that deviate by more than one standard deviation from their historical distribution have a low probability of occurring and thus are easier to identify as abnormally high prices. Data Sources:        FAO relies on official domestic price data that it compiles in the Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) tool to calculate and monitor the indicator. Five cereal products will be monitored: maize & maize products, wheat & wheat flour, rice, sorghum and millet. While diets across the world have become more diversified with increasing incomes, cereals still account for 45 percent of a person's daily caloric intake, making this commodity group the most important in terms of its contribution to caloric intake, particularly for low income populations (FAOSTAT, 2017). For the purpose of a more comprehensive coverage at the global level, FAO also calculates IFPA on countries' officially reported food price indices as reported in FAOSTAT, which facilitates cross country comparisons as it uses a national level food basket covering all the most important commodities consumed. While the basket differs from country to country, this approach is more reflective of national and global trends as countries have predefined the commodities that have the most impact on local consumers. This approach also facilitates the implementation of the indicator as countries will not be asked to create a new index or modify existing methodologies.            For the Food CPI, the FAOSTAT monthly CPI & Food CPI database was based on the ILO CPI data until December 2014. In 2014, IMF-ILO-FAO agreed to transfer global CPI data compilation from ILO to IMF. Upon agreement, CPIs for all items and its sub components originates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Statistics Division(UNSD) for countries not covered by the IMF. However, due to a limited time coverage from IMF and UNSD for a number of countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European statistics (EUROSTAT), the Latin America and the Caribbean statistics (CEPALSTAT), Central Bank of Western African States (BCEAO), Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and national statistical office website data are used for missing historical data from IMF and UNSD food CPI.  The FAO CPI dataset for all items (or general CPI) and the Food CPI, consists of a complete and consistent set of time series from January 2000 onwards.  It further contains regional and global food CPIs compiled by FAO using population weights to aggregate across countries.

Agriculture value-added Agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the System of National Accounts (SNA). AOI = Agriculture share of government expenditures / Agriculture value added share of GDP        Where:        Agriculture share of government expenditures = (Central government expenditure on agriculture / Total centrl government expenditure) x 100                Agriculture refers to COFOG category 042 (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting); and        (Agriculture value-added share of GDP = AGriculture value added / GDP) * 100                Agriculture refers to the Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting), equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2. Since the numerator of this data is based on administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government expenditure data. For the denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.      The key limitation with this indicator is that it takes into account only central government expenditure. To the extent that some countries may have heavier intervention in agriculture by sub-national governments, this will not be taken into account. An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government's orientation to the agriculture sector.            Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.            Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints.             However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe price changes.             Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.            An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A's economy is 10 times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take economic size into account.             An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure fails to take into account the relative contributions of the agricultural sector to a country's GDP. Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to C's GDP, and 10 per cent to country D's GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.            The AOI index takes into account a country's economic size, Agriculture's contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and achievable target. Nonetheless, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP. Data sources:Data on government expenditures is collected from countries using an annual questionnaire administered by FAO. Since countries typically compile government expenditure data based on their financial systems, and is administrative data covering the entirely of government expenditures, particularly at the central government level, there is no sampling issue and no possibility of sampling error. For some countries that do not report such data to FAO, data may be obtained from the IMF GFS database (which includes similar data but covering more sectors, and with less disaggregation of COFOG 042) or from official national governmental websites.       Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the system of national accounts, which is an analytical framework that compiles national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. This data is obtained from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.            Collection process:      Data for the denominator are annually collected from countries using the FAO questionnaire on Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA), developed in collaboration with the IMF. Data from countries may be supplemented, for missing countries, with data collected by the IMF, or published on official national governmental websites. The official counterpart(s) at country level are, depending on the country, from the national statistics office, the ministry of finance (or other central planning agency), or the ministry of agriculture.

Governmhttps://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-01.pdfent Expenditure are classified according to the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), a classification developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD). Agriculture value-added Agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the System of National Accounts (SNA). AOI = Agriculture share of government expenditures / Agriculture value added share of GDP        Where:        Agriculture share of government expenditures = (Central government expenditure on agriculture / Total centrl government expenditure) x 100                Agriculture refers to COFOG category 042 (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting); and        (Agriculture value-added share of GDP = AGriculture value added / GDP) * 100                Agriculture refers to the Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting), equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2. Since the numerator of this data is based on administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government expenditure data. For the denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.      The key limitation with this indicator is that it takes into account only central government expenditure. To the extent that some countries may have heavier intervention in agriculture by sub-national governments, this will not be taken into account. An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government's orientation to the agriculture sector.            Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.            Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints.             However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe price changes.             Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.            An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A's economy is 10 times that of country B, setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take economic size into account.             An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure fails to take into account the relative contributions of the agricultural sector to a country's GDP. Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to C's GDP, and 10 per cent to country D's GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.            The AOI index takes into account a country's economic size, Agriculture's contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and achievable target. Nonetheless, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP. Data sources:Data on government expenditures is collected from countries using an annual questionnaire administered by FAO. Since countries typically compile government expenditure data based on their financial systems, and is administrative data covering the entirely of government expenditures, particularly at the central government level, there is no sampling issue and no possibility of sampling error. For some countries that do not report such data to FAO, data may be obtained from the IMF GFS database (which includes similar data but covering more sectors, and with less disaggregation of COFOG 042) or from official national governmental websites.       Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the system of national accounts, which is an analytical framework that compiles national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. This data is obtained from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.            Collection process:      Data for the denominator are annually collected from countries using the FAO questionnaire on Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA), developed in collaboration with the IMF. Data from countries may be supplemented, for missing countries, with data collected by the IMF, or published on official national governmental websites. The official counterpart(s) at country level are, depending on the country, from the national statistics office, the ministry of finance (or other central planning agency), or the ministry of agriculture. Validation and consultation were conducted through various FAO commissions and committees, including its two agricultural statistics commissions in Africa and the Asia and Pacific, its Committee on Agriculture and Livestock Statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean, and its Committee on Agriculture.

"SDG_SI_DST_FISP","Redistributive impact of fiscal policy, Gini index (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Redistributive impact of fiscal policy, Gini index (%) The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is defined as the Gini index of prefiscal per capita (or equivalized) income less the Gini index of postfiscal per capita (or equivalized) income. Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy Defined as the Gini index of prefiscal household income less the Gini index of postfiscal household income. These terms are elaborated below and can be calculated with some different variations. Gini index A commonly used measure of inequality capturing the statistical dispersion in the distribution of income over a population (Gini, 1936).  A Gini index of zero expresses perfect equality: that is, every individual in the population has the same income. A Gini index of 100 expresses maximum inequality: that is, all income accrues to a single individual, and all other individuals have zero income.  Household income This can be calculated: (i) in per capita terms (household income divided by the number of household members); or (ii) in equivalized terms (household income divided by the square root of the number of household members). If a different definition is used, it should be noted in the reporting document. Prefiscal income can be derived from a nationally-representative micro-data set (an Income and Expenditure Survey, for example). Postfiscal income is estimated via the allocation of the tax burdens and the expenditure-based benefits that stem from fiscal policy (direct and indirect taxes, social contributions, direct cash and near-cash transfers, subsidies, et cetera). Procedures for constructing prefiscal and postfiscal income concepts and estimating their distribution from an underlying microdata set are detailed comprehensively in Lustig (2018) (Chapters 1, 6, and 7). The Gini Index is calculated rescaling the Gini Coefficient by a factor of 100. The Gini Coefficient is calculated according to standard formulas for a (generalized) Gini Coefficient. Reporting on assumptions: The choice of whether to report the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator under the pensions as deferred income or pensions as transfers scenario will be left to the country authority or international agency in charge of submitting this indicator, but the choice must be clearly indicated in the reporting document.  For countries for which the data exist, prefiscal and postfiscal inequality should be calculated for both pension scenarios, and the default included in the SDGs database is pension as deferred income. If only data treating pensions as transfers are available, it is recommended to report them only for the working age population (under 65 years of age). Some authorities may also choose to use equivalized income instead of per capita income as the welfare indicator. This too should be clearly indicated in the reporting document. Last, some authorities may report these data based on a micro-data set using income or expenditure as the relevant welfare concept. Once these decisions are taken, they should be maintained in subsequent years in order to assure comparability, except that all countries are encouraged to provide data with pension as deferred income. The data reported in the UN Global Database try, to the extent possible, to distinguish between the different concepts used for different countries.Feasibility: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator can be estimated for any country with a micro-data set detailing incomes or expenditures (or both) at the household or individual level and with a set of fiscal, administrative, or budgetary records detailing public expenditures at the program level and revenue collections at the revenue-collection instrument level.Suitability/Relevance: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator provides a direct estimate of the current impact of fiscal policy on redistribution (of incomes). It therefore provides a direct estimate of progress on SDG Target 10.4: 'Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality.' Limitations: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator does not address wage policy. It does not include the benefits of public provision of in-kind benefits, such as health, education, sanitation and housing services, which may have both present-day and longer-term impacts on present-day and future inequality. Developed by the Commitment to Equity Institute (CEQ) at Tulane University, the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator demonstrates in an accounting framework the total amount by which current income inequality is reduced or increased by the current execution of fiscal policy (including direct and indirect taxes; social insurance and old-age pension contributions; direct cash or near-cash transfers; and subsidies).  For example, if the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy is positive, that indicates that the net effect of Fiscal Policy is to reduce the Gini index from what it otherwise would be without Fiscal Policy (in an accounting sense, not as an economic counterfactual).   The indicator allows policy makers and the broader stakeholder and advocacy communities to systematically track progress at the country level in the contribution of fiscal policy to more equitable societies. Data sources:The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator requires a nationally representative micro-data set (a Household Budget Survey, for example, or and Income and Expenditure Survey) and, especially for the construction of Consumable Income, fiscal or budgetary or administrative data on revenue collections, social expenditures, and expenditures on consumption subsidies. Collection process:Nationally representative micro-data sets are often collected and hosted by the national statistics agency. However, access to such data sets is frequently given to a different part of the administration (the Ministry of Finance, for example, or the Ministry of Development and Planning). Fiscal or budgetary or administrative data is occasionally available in unabridged summaries with enough detail at the program or policy level for the estimation of the indicator.  More often, however, budgetary and administrative data is kept by the agency executing the program (so, for example, the Ministry of Education will keep data on its own fiscal-year expenditures).The validation process requires consultation with each of the ministries and agencies responsible for executing programmatic expenditures or revenue collections. Indicator release: 2020.Q4.G.02 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income, as well as those based on sex, age, disability, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity—both within and among countries.

"SDG_SL_TLF_UEMDIS","Unemployment rate, by sex and disability (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Unemployment rate, by sex and disability (%) The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed. Unemployed persons Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) 'not in employment' is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to 'seek employment' refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural  undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise’s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) 'currently available' serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups). Persons in employment Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as one week or one day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. Labour force The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment. Unemployment rate = (Total unemployment / Total labour force) * 100 Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate is useful as an indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key measure of labour underutilization, in many developing countries, the significance and meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization. The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search. Data sources:The preferred official national data source for this indicator is a household-based labour force survey. In the absence of a labour force survey, a population census and/or other type of household surveys with an appropriate employment module may also be used to obtain the required data. It is important to note that unemployment data derived from employment office records or unemployment registers would not refer to unemployment (as defined for the purposes of this indicator, using the three-criteria of being without a job, seeking employment and available for employment) but to registered unemployment, and thus, it would not be comparable with indicator 8.5.2.Collection process:The ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire on labour statistics to all relevant agencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting for the latest annual data available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG indicators. Indicator 8.5.2 is calculated from statistics submitted to the ILO via this questionnaire as well as through special agreements with regional and national statistical offices or through the processing of microdata sets of national labour force surveys.

The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women's Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 45 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family . The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans. Discrimination against women Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women.  Article 1 of CEDAW states: '. the term 'discrimination against women' shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field'.The term 'legal frameworks' is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms and policies/plans to 'promote, enforce and monitor' gender equality.  Legal frameworks that 'promote' are those that establish women's equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination on the basis of sex. Legal frameworks that 'enforce and monitor' are directed to the realization of equality and non-discrimination and implementation of laws, such as policies/plans, establishment of enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, and allocation of financial resources.NANA Scoring:The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality using a questionnaire comprising 45 Yes/No questions under four areas of law drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular, CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action.  The answers to the questions are coded with simple 'Yes/No' answers with '1' for 'Yes' and '0' for 'No'. For questions 1 and 2 only, they may be scored 'N/A' in which case they are not included as part of the overall score calculation for the area.   The scoring methodology is the unweighted average of the questions under each area of law calculated by:Ai = (q1 + ... + qmi) / miWhere Ai refers the area of law i; mi refers to the total number of questions under the area of law i;  q1+...+qmi refers to the sum of the coded questions under the area of law and where qi='1' if the answer is 'Yes' and qi='0' if the answer is 'No'.Results of the four areas are reported as percentages as a dashboard: (A1, A2, A3, A4). The score for each area (a number between 0 and 100) therefore represents the percentage of achievement of that country in that area, with 100 being best practice met on all questions in the area. The choice of presenting all four area scores without further aggregation is the result of adopting the posture that high values in one area in a given country need not compensate in any way the country having low values in some other area, and that a comprehensive examination of the value of those four numbers for each country is potentially more informative than trying to summarize all four numbers into a single index. To avoid duplication, the indicator does not cover areas of law that are addressed under indicator 5.a.2, 'Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women's equal rights to land ownership and/or control', and indicator 5.6.2, 'Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education'.  Indicator 5.1.1 complements these other indicators. Equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex are core principles under the international legal and policy framework, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. This framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal frameworks. In the Beijing Platform for Action, States pledged to revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex. The five-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing + 5) established 2005 as the target date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many countries.  Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation persist.Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and achieving gender equality (Goal 5, Target 5.1).

The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women's Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 45 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family . The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans. Discrimination against women Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women.  Article 1 of CEDAW states: '. the term 'discrimination against women' shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field'.The term 'legal frameworks' is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms and policies/plans to 'promote, enforce and monitor' gender equality.  Legal frameworks that 'promote' are those that establish women's equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination on the basis of sex. Legal frameworks that 'enforce and monitor' are directed to the realization of equality and non-discrimination and implementation of laws, such as policies/plans, establishment of enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, and allocation of financial resources.NANA Scoring:The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality using a questionnaire comprising 45 Yes/No questions under four areas of law drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular, CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action.  The answers to the questions are coded with simple 'Yes/No' answers with '1' for 'Yes' and '0' for 'No'. For questions 1 and 2 only, they may be scored 'N/A' in which case they are not included as part of the overall score calculation for the area.   The scoring methodology is the unweighted average of the questions under each area of law calculated by:Ai = (q1 + ... + qmi) / miWhere Ai refers the area of law i; mi refers to the total number of questions under the area of law i;  q1+...+qmi refers to the sum of the coded questions under the area of law and where qi='1' if the answer is 'Yes' and qi='0' if the answer is 'No'.Results of the four areas are reported as percentages as a dashboard: (A1, A2, A3, A4). The score for each area (a number between 0 and 100) therefore represents the percentage of achievement of that country in that area, with 100 being best practice met on all questions in the area. The choice of presenting all four area scores without further aggregation is the result of adopting the posture that high values in one area in a given country need not compensate in any way the country having low values in some other area, and that a comprehensive examination of the value of those four numbers for each country is potentially more informative than trying to summarize all four numbers into a single index. To avoid duplication, the indicator does not cover areas of law that are addressed under indicator 5.a.2, 'Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women's equal rights to land ownership and/or control', and indicator 5.6.2, 'Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education'.  Indicator 5.1.1 complements these other indicators. Equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex are core principles under the international legal and policy framework, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. This framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal frameworks. In the Beijing Platform for Action, States pledged to revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex. The five-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing + 5) established 2005 as the target date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many countries.  Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation persist.Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and achieving gender equality (Goal 5, Target 5.1).

The indicator is computed as a ratio of annual output to the number of working days in one year.             FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who:       - operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and       - operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units - TLUs); and       - obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars. Small-scale food producers Small-scale food producers are defined as those falling in the intersection of the bottom 40 percent of the cumulative distribution of land, livestock and revenues.

One TLU is the metabolic weight equivalent of one cattle in North America. The complete list of conversion factors can be found in the Guidelines for the preparation of livestock sector Reviews Productivity The concept of productivity is standardized by OECD's Manual for Measuring Productivity.

More information on possible definitions can be found in 'Productivity and Efficiency Measurement in Agriculture: Literature Review and Gaps Analysis' See formula in https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-03-01.pdf A major limitation is data availability. In reality, surveys collecting all the required information simultaneously at the farm level are very few. The most appropriate data source for collecting information on total volume of agricultural production and on labour input adopted on the agricultural holding would be agricultural surveys. However, in many countries, especially in a developing context, agricultural surveys are seldom conducted. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has emphasized the importance of enhancing productivity of small-scale food producers, as these producers play an important role in the global production of food. The indicator monitors progress in this area, where the target is to double productivity by year 2030.       The enhancement of labour productivity in small-scale production units also has implications on poverty reduction, as small-scale food producers are often poor, and are frequently found to be close to subsistence conditions. Data sources: Given that indicator 2.3.1 is measured on a target population of producers - those considered as small-scale - the ideal data source for measuring them is a single survey that collects all the information required with reference to individual production units. The most appropriate data source for collecting information on total volume of agricultural production and on labour input adopted on the agricultural holding would be agricultural surveys.

"SDG_SG_GEN_LOCGELS","Proportion of elected seats held by women in deliberative bodies of local government (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of elected seats held by women in deliberative bodies of local government (%) INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)The proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments, currently as at 1 January of reporting year, is currently measured as the number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of members of parliament.INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the proportion of positions held by women in local government.It is expressed as a percentage of elected positions held by women in legislative/ deliberative bodies of local government. Seats (5.5.1a) Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election. Local government (5.5.1b) Local government is one of the sub-national spheres of government and a result of decentralization, a process of transferring political, fiscal, and administrative powers from the central government to sub-national units of government distributed across the territory of a country to regulate and/or run certain government functions or public services on their own. The definition of local government follows the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) distinction between central, state, and local government (para 4.129). Local government consists of local government units, defined in the SNA as 'institutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes' (para 4.145). What constitutes local government of a given country is defined by that country's national legal framework, including national constitutions and local government acts or equivalent legislation.Each local government unit typically includes a legislative/ deliberative body and an executive body. Legislative/ deliberative bodies, such as councils or assemblies, are formal entities with a prescribed number of members as per national or state legislation. They are usually elected by universal suffrage and have decision-making power, including the ability to issue by-laws, on a range of local aspects of public affairs. Executive bodies, consisting of an executive committee or a mayor, may be elected, appointed or nominated and they prepare and execute decisions made by the legislative/ deliberative body. Elected positions are the most common manner of selection of local government members. They are selected in local elections, based on a system of choosing political office holders in which the voters cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The category of elected positions includes both elected persons who competed on openly contested seats and persons selected during the electoral processes on reserved seats or through a candidate quota.By comparison, members selected on appointed positions (the least common manner of selection of local government members) are nominated, typically by government officials from higher-ranking tiers of government. Appointed members of local government are more frequent among the leadership positions, such as the heads of the executive body, representatives of specific groups (e.g., women, disadvantaged groups, youth); and, temporary committees/delegations/caretakers appointed by government officials when a council has been dissolved.NA INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament.There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)The method of computation is as follows:Indicator 5.5.1(b) = (Number of seats held by women * 100) / Total number of seats held by women and men (unit: %) INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events which are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in upper chambers of parliament. The information in available on the IPU website at https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking.- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women's contribution to political decision making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)Indicator 5.5.1(b) refers to the representation of women among elected positions of legislative/deliberative bodies of local government. This is a strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, and mirrors the SDG indicator measuring women's representation at national level, in parliament. This is also a limitation in that the indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local government officials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously holding a position within the legislative/deliberative body, or who are appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator. It is recommended that women's representation in executive positions, particularly at the level of the head of the executive (such as mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels, but not as a headline SDG indicator.Importantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of local government and not the quality of their participation. Countries may therefore consider assessing political participation through national or subnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research. Additional indicators of political participation may also be monitored at national level, such as women's share among voters and candidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps on women's political participation.  Finally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of local government, such as public administration staff, are not included in the indicator 5.5.1(b), and may be covered by other indicators in the SDG framework, particularly within the Goal 16 on inclusive societies. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a)        The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision making. Women's participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women's opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women's empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 per cent.A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies.Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women's participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women's access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase women's shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.        INDICATOR 5.5.1(b)        Women's and men's right to exercise their political rights on an equal basis, and at all levels of decision-making, is recognized in the SDGs and enshrined in many human and political rights declarations, conventions and resolutions agreed to by most countries in the world. Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the degree to which gender balance has been achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in local government. Indicator 5.5.1(b) complements the Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in national parliaments, and accounts for the representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are covered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government. INDICATOR 5.5.1(a): Data sources:The data used are official statistics received from parliaments. The data are provided by national parliaments and updated after an election or parliamentary renewal. National parliaments also transmit their data to the IPU at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat. After each general election or renewal a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary web sites or Internet searches. Additional information gathered from other sources is regularly crosschecked with parliament. INDICATOR 5.5.1(b): Data sources:Administrative data based on electoral records are the main source of data on elected members of local government, and the recommended data source for Indicator 5.5.1(b). Electoral records are produced and upheld by Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs) or equivalent bodies tasked with organizing elections at local level. EMBs are part of the National Statistical System, and often specifically mentioned in the national statistics acts as producers of official statistics. The use of electoral records to measure women's representation in local government and monitoring of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is cost-effective, straightforward and timely. No adjustments or estimates are necessary to transform the administrative information into statistics for monitoring the indicator. The conceptual framework at the basis of Indicator 5.5.1(b) is consistent with the conceptual framework at the basis of local elections, as both are provided by national legal framework. The data used to calculate Indicator 5.5.1(b) refer to information on election winners, disaggregated by sex, and the coverage of the reference population (in this case, the elected officials) should be complete. In countries where the electoral records are electronic and centralized, information on numbers of women and men in elected positions can be made available as soon as the official results of elections are released. Two other types of sources of data may be used in the few instances where electoral records are not electronic or not centralized. One additional type of source is also administrative, and refers to public administration data available to line ministries overseeing local government. However, its use for statistics may be less straightforward compared to centralized electoral records. The scope of public administration records is beyond the elected positions, and information on women and men in elected positions of local government may be mixed with information on public administration employees, which are not covered by this indicator. Therefore, additional data processing and resources may be required to carefully extract the information needed. In some cases, the forms used as the basis for administrative records may need to be modified to ensure recording of the positions as being elected, in legislative/deliberative bodies, as well as the sex of persons in those positions. In other cases, some elected positions may not be covered in the records maintained, for example, if the administrative records are restricted to only those positions that are on the government payroll. Another type of data source that may provide information on women and men in local government in the absence of centralized electronic election records, refers to existing surveys or censuses using local government units as units of observation. These surveys or censuses may be undertaken by National Statistical Offices and/or line ministries and may take the form of (a) local government censuses or surveys; (b) establishment survey; and (c) municipality surveys. These surveys/census may already include, in the data collection tool dedicated to their main purpose, a few questions on the number of members of local legislative/deliberative and executive bodies by sex and other individual characteristics such as age and education; or may require the integration of such questions. Similar to other censuses and surveys, a low response rate can result in bias of the statistics obtained. Sampling errors may also add to the bias, in ways that cannot be assessed in the absence of a good understanding of distribution of women's and men's representation across different local government units across the territory of a country.Collection process:The compilation of data, coordinated by UN Women and undertaken with the support of UN Regional Commissions, uses two mechanisms:-	data request forms sent to EMBs and NSOs directly or through UN Regional Commissions -	on-line dissemination of data by NSS entities who are the primary source of data or in charge with coordination of SDGs, including EMBs and/or NSOs. This process will be done in a transparent manner, based on communication with NSS focal points, so that the NSS has a chance to validate or dismiss a country's compiled data.

"SDG_SG_GEN_EQPWN","Proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment (%) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.c.1 seeks to measure government efforts to track budget allocations for gender equality throughout the public finance management cycle and to make these publicly available. This is an indicator of characteristics of the fiscal system. It is not an indicator of quantity or quality of finance allocated for gender equality and women's empowerment (GEWE). The indicator measures three criteria. The first focuses on the intent of a government to address GEWE by identifying if it has programs/policies and resource allocations to foster GEWE. The second assesses if a government has planning and budget tools to track resources for GEWE throughout the public financial management cycle. The third focuses on transparency by identifying if a government has provisions to make allocations for GEWE publicly available.The indicator aims to encourage national governments to develop appropriate budget tracking and monitoring systems and commit to making information about allocations for gender equality readily available to the public. The system should be led by the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the sectoral ministries and National Women's Machineries and overseen by an appropriate body such as Parliament or Public Auditors. Programs or policies of the government, that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals - Programs or policies that specifically target only women and/or girls. For example, a government program that provides scholarships for girls only, or a prenatal care program, or a National Action Plan on Gender Equality; or- Programs or policies that target both women or girls and men or boys and have gender equality as the primary objective. For example, a national public information campaign against gender violence, or on-the-job training programs on gender equality; or- Programs or policies where gender equality is not the primary objective but the program includes action to close gender gaps. These programs could include provision of infrastructure, public services and social protection. For example, an infrastructure program that has a provision for using women labour, or a public transportation program that takes into consideration the mobility needs of women in its design. Programs or policies have adequate resources allocated within the budget, sufficient to meet both their general objectives and their gender equality goals The programs or policies that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals are allocated sufficient resources to cover the costs of meeting those goals from funding that is included in the budget rather than from off-budget sources. Procedures in place to ensure that these resources are executed according to the budget There are procedures established in laws or regulations so that resources for programs or policies that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals are executed as specified in the budget or if there are deviations in the exercise from the budgeted allocations, government agencies must justify to a supervising entity (e.g. ministries of finance, parliaments, audit bodies, or other relevant authorities) the reason for not executing resources according to budget. The method of computation is as follows: Indicator 5.c.1 = (Number of countries the FULLY meet requirements / Total number of countries) * 100                 The indicator does not measure allocation of resources but the existence of mechanisms to track resource allocations and that make that information available publicly. However, there is an optional question in the questionnaire (not scored) that requests countries to report the percentage of the government budget allocated for gender equality programs. Another limitation is that the indicator, which is process oriented, does not provide data on the adequacy or quality of resource allocations. Adequate and effective financing is essential to achieve SDG 5 and the gender related targets across the SDG framework. By tracking and making public gender equality allocations, governments promote greater transparency in and hence this could result in better accountability. The indicator encourages governments to put in place a system to track and make public resource allocations which can then inform policy review, better policy formulation and more effective public financial management.  The principle of adequate financing for gender equality is rooted in the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action (para 345 and 346) adopted in 1995. However, the Secretary General's report on the twenty-year review and appraisal of the Platform for Action found that underinvestment in gender equality and women's empowerment has contributed to slow and uneven progress in all 12 critical areas of concern. Inadequate financing hinders the implementation of gender responsive laws and policies. Data shows that financing gaps are sometimes a high as 90% with critical shortfalls in infrastructure, productive and economic sectors.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Agenda commits to a 'significant increase in investments to close the gender gap.' Ensuring requisite resources for gender equality is central to implementing and achieving SDG 5 and all gender targets across the framework. Tracking these allocations and making the data publicly available are important steps to assess progress towards meeting these goals. This has been reaffirmed at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, where member states adopted the Addis Ababa Action Agenda which commits to track gender equality allocations and increase transparency on public spending.  Furthermore, the Commission on the Status of Women at its 60th session called upon states to support and institutionalize gender-responsive budgeting and tracking across all sectors of public expenditure to address gaps in resourcing for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.Indicator 5.c.1 will measure the percentage of governments with systems to track and make public resource allocations for gender equality. It builds on Indicator 8 of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation that has been piloted, tested and rolled out in 81 countries. Indicator 8 allowed, for the first time, the systematic collection of data on government efforts to track resource allocations for gender equality across countries. Indicator 5.c.1 is defined in almost identical terms to Indicator 8 of the GPEDC. In addition, Indicator 5.c.1 is the only indicator in the SDG monitoring framework that links national budgeting systems with implementation of legislation and policies for gender equality and women's empowerment.The refined methodology for Indicator 5.c.1 is an improvement over the original methodology for Indicator 8. The increased specificity of the criteria provides a greater level of detail and therefore, captures the variability in countries' gender equality policies and public financial management systems. The application of a tiered scoring approach with specific thresholds increases the indicator's rigor and gives incentive to countries to improve these systems over time. Further, it is envisaged that the OECD Survey of Budget Practices and Procedures, conducted regularly among OECD countries, will be modified and updated to align closely with Indicator 5.c.1. This will allow greater global coverage by strengthening the indicator's relevance to ministries of finance in all countries. Data sources:An electronic questionnaire with accompanying monitoring guidance will be used to collect data on this indicator. Collection process:It is envisaged that data collection will be undertaken as part of the country-level monitoring of effective development cooperation (SDG 17.16.1) where the Global Partnership monitoring framework provides a useful platform and mechanism. The Global Partnership monitoring is led by national coordinators appointed by their respective government to coordinate data collection and validation across relevant government ministries, departments and agencies. For this indicator, the national coordinator will liaise with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Women and other relevant ministries to complete the questionnaire. UN Women country office focal points will be available for support. With the GPEDC monitoring process generally launched early in the year, national coordinators will have until the end of the year to complete the data collection and validation at country level before submission to the JST for consolidation and analysis.

Also includes biogases from anaerobic fermentation (e.g. landfill gas, sewage sludge gas, fermentation of energy crops and manure) and thermal processes (also known as syngas); waste fired power plants making use of biodegradable municipal waste (household waste and waste from companies and public services that resembles household waste, collected at installations specifically designed for their disposal with recovery of combustible liquids, gases or heat). See code 23360 for non-renewable waste-fired power plants.Research and development of energy efficiency technologies and measures is captured under CRS sector code 23182 on Energy research. The above flows also include technical assistance provided to support production, research and development as defined above.IRENA: The flows covered by IRENA are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed in the UN M49 composition of regions) from all foreign governments, multilateral agencies and additional development finance institutions (including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. These additional flows cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed above and exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/DAC CRS.     The OECD flows are calculated by taking the total official flows (ODA and OOF) from DAC member countries, multilateral organisations and other providers of development assistance to the sectors listed above. The IRENA (additional) flows are calculated by taking the total public investment flows from IRENA's Public Renewable Energy Investment Database and excluding: domestic financial flows; international flows to countries outside developing regions; and flows reported by OECD (as described above). The flows are commitments measured in current United States Dollars (USD). Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered complete since 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. At present, flows to clean energy research and development are only partially covered by the database and a few other areas (e.g. off-grid electricity supply, investments in improved cookstove projects) may be covered only partially. The IRENA database currently only covers financial institutions that have invested a total of USD 400 million or more in renewable energy. The process of continuous improvement of the database includes verifying the data against data produced by the multilateral development banks for climate finance reporting and by comparing the data with other independent reporting by international development finance agencies. Total ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify the public financial effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to developing countries for renewable energies. The additional flows (from the IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries and institutions not currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export credits. Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies to meet their future energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. This indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing countries to access these technologies. Data sources: The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc.IRENA's data on financial flows from public sources in support of renewable energy are available in IRENA's Public Renewable Energy Investment Database. IRENA collects this data from a wide range of publicly available sources, including the databases and annual reports of all of the main development finance institutions and 20 other bilateral and multilateral agencies investing in renewable energy. The database is updated annually and (at end-2016) covers public renewable energy investment flowing to 29 developed countries and 104 developing countries, for the period 2000-2015.

"SDG_ER_RSK_LBREDS","Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk as a share of local breeds with known level of extinction risk (%)","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=10&Target","https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi/swagger/"," Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk as a share of local breeds with known level of extinction risk (%) The indicator presents the percentage of local livestock breeds among local breeds with known risk status classified as being at risk of extinctions at a certain moment in time, as well as the trends for this percentage. Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals A similar indicator was originally proposed for the Target 15.5, and it serves also as an indicator for the Aichi Target 13 'Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals' under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It is described on the webpage of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP), a network of organizations, which have come together to provide the most up-to date biodiversity information possible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets (http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals). Further, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, page 91 (see http://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en-lr.pdf) which is an output of the processes under the CBD.NANA The indicator is based on the data contained in FAO's Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources DAD-IS (http://dad.fao.org/). Risk classes are defined based on population sizes of breeds reported to DAD-IS. The risk class is considered to be 'unknown' if (i) no population sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than 10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point).        Species are assigned to two groups. The first group comprises species that have high reproductive capacity, such as pigs, rabbits, guinea pigs and avian species, and the second comprises species that have low reproductive capacity, i.e. those belonging to the taxonomical families Bovidae, Equidae, Camelidae and Cervidae.            The risk status categories are defined as follows (see also FAO. 2013). In vivo conservation of animal genetic resources. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines. No. 14. Rome. Accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf.):             Extinct. A breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females remaining and any cryoconserved genetic material that may be available is insufficient for breed reconstitution.      Cryoconserved only. Breeds that have no living male or female animals remaining, but for which there is sufficient cryopreserved material to allow for reconstitution of the breed, are assigned to the category cryoconserved only. The ability to reconstitute an otherwise extinct breed depends on the amount of and type of stored germplasm. Requirements differ greatly according to species. Guidance on what constitutes 'sufficient cryopreserved material' is provided in the FAO guidelines Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources (FAO, 2012).            Critical. A breed is categorized as critical if:      - the total number of breeding females is less than or equal to 100 (300 for species with low reproductive capacity); or      - the overall population size is less than or equal to 80 (240) and the population trend is increasing and the proportion of females being bred to males of the same breed is greater than 80 percent (i.e. cross-breeding is equal to or less than 20 percent); or      - the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 (360) and the population trend is stable or decreasing; or      - the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five (i.e. Î<U+0094>F is 3 percent or greater).      If the population trend is unknown, then it is assumed to be stable.      Breeds for which demographic characteristics suggest a critical risk of extinction, but that have active conservation programmes (including cryoconservation) in place, or populations that are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions are considered to be 'critical-maintained' for reporting purposes.            Endangered. A breed is categorized as endangered if:      - the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 (300 for species with low reproductive capacity) and less than or equal to 1 000 (3 000); or      - the overall population size is greater than 80 (240) and less than 800 (2400) and increasing in size and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or      - the overall population size is greater than 120 (360) and less than or equal to 1200 (3600) and the trend is stable or decreasing; or      - the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five (i.e. Î<U+0094>F is between 1 and 3 percent).      Once again, if the population trend is unknown, then it is assumed to be stable.            Endangered breeds will be assigned to the subcategory 'endangered-maintained' if active conservation programmes are in place or if their populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions.            Vulnerable. A breed is categorized as vulnerable if:      - the total number of breeding females is between 1000 and 2000 (3000 and 6000 for species with low reproductive capacity); or      - the overall population size is greater than 800 (2400) and less than or equal to 1600 (4800) and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is greater than 80 percent; or      - the overall population size is greater than 1 200 (3600) and less than or equal to 2400 (7200) but stable or decreasing; or      - the total number of breeding males is between 20 and 35 (i.e. the Î<U+0094>F is between 0.5 and 1 percent).      Unreported population trends are assumed to be stable.            Not at risk. A breed is categorized as not at risk if the population status is known and the breed does not fall in the critical or endangered categories (including the respective subcategories) or the vulnerable category.             Unknown. This category is self-explanatory and calls for action. A population survey is needed; the breed could be critical, endangered or vulnerable.            - A Breed is considered to be at risk if it has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, endangered-maintained or vulnerable.              The indicator is calculated as follows:        nR = At risk        nNR = Not at risk        nU = Unknown        n = nR + nNR + nU = All risk classes            SDG indicator for country i: Pi = nRi / (nRi + nNRi) Breed-related information remains far from complete. Across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 65 percent of local breeds are classified as of unknown status because of missing population data or lack of recent updates.       Generally, data collection should be possible in all countries. Updating of population size data at least each 10 years is needed for the definition of the risk classes. The indicator has a direct link to 'biodiversity' as animal or livestock genetic resources represent an integral part of agricultural ecosystems and biodiversity as such. Further there are indirect links to 'malnutrition': Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a thousand million people. A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution to the eradication of hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial in adapting to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions, including climate change. They are the animal breeder's raw material and amongst the farmer's most essential inputs. They are essential for sustainable agricultural production.       No increase of the percentage of breeds being at risk or being extinct is directly related to 'halt the loss of biodiversity'. Data sources: DAD-IS is the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System maintained and developed by FAO (http://www.fao.org/dad-is/en/). It provides access to searchable databases of breed-related information and photos and links to other online resources on livestock diversity. It allows to analyze the diversity of livestock breeds on national, regional and global levels including the status of breeds regarding their risk of extinction.  DAD-IS currently contains data from 182 countries and 38 species.  It contains information on more than 8,800 mammalian and avian breeds, among those about 7,700 are considered local (i.e. reported to occur in only one country).

The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators. Access to basic services Access to basic services implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate quality. Access to Basic Drinking Water Services Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to the use of drinking water from an improved source that is available with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing. Improved sources include: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the JMP drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services.

For example, elements of basic services are measured under indicators 3.8.1 (health), 4.1.1 (education), 6.1.1 (water), 6.2.1 (sanitation), 7.1.1 (energy), 11.2.1 (public transport), etc.        Finally, many countries still have limited capacities for data management, data collection and monitoring, and continue to struggle with limited data on large or densely populated geographical areas. This means that complementarity in data reporting in a few exceptions is needed to ensure that both national and global figures achieve consistencies in the final reported data for access to basic services. Poverty has many dimensions. It is not only a lack of material well-being but also a lack of opportunities to live a tolerable life. The international extreme poverty line was updated in 2015 to 1.90 USD per day using 2011 purchasing power parity (WB 2015). Living under the extreme poverty line often encompasses deprivations of safe drinking water, proper sanitation, access to modern energy, sustainable mobility to economic resources, information technology, healthcare, education, etc. Poverty is also a manifestation of hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion as well as the lack of participation in decision-making. In other words, poverty is multidimensional and covers many aspects of life ranging from access to opportunities, livelihoods and means of survival.        Among the different aspects of poverty, this indicator focuses on 'access to basic services'. Providing access to basic services such as safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, sustainable energy and mobility, housing, education, healthcare etc, helps to improve the quality of life of the poor. The lack of basic services provision and the lack of empowerment and involvement of local governments in basic service delivery undermine the economic growth and quality of life in any community. Adequate basic service delivery systems promote socio-economic improvements and help to achieve economic growth, social inclusion, poverty reduction and equality. More specifically, improved basic services can help to raise well-being and productivity of communities, create jobs, save time and human effort in transporting water, support food security, better use of energy, production of essential commodities, improve health (by making medical care, clean water or solid waste collection available) or enhance the level of education.        In the Quito implementation plan for the New Urban Agenda adopted in Habitat III conference, member states commit to 'promoting equitable and affordable access to sustainable basic physical and social infrastructure for all, without discrimination, including affordable serviced land, housing, modern and renewable energy, safe drinking water and sanitation, safe, nutritious and adequate food, waste disposal, sustainable mobility, health care and family planning, education, culture, and information and communications technologies'. They further commit to 'ensuring that these services are responsive to the rights and needs of women, children and youth, older persons and persons with disabilities, migrants, indigenous peoples and local communities, as appropriate, and to those of others in vulnerable situations'.        Basic service delivery must move towards a demand-driven approach, which is appropriate for the local needs - and hence able to respond to the concept of 'Access for all' - as stated in the NUA. Basic services are fundamental to improving living standards. Governments have the responsibility for their provision. This indicator will measure levels of accessibility to basic services and guide the efforts of governments for provision of equitable basic services for all to eradicate poverty. Data sources: The main source of data for this indicator remains household surveys including DHS, MICS, LSMS, World Bank, UNICEF and UNDP, the censuses and administrative data. These data sources are also described in the various metadata for the constituent SDG indicators.

The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators. Access to basic services Access to basic services implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate quality. Access to Basic Drinking Water Services Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to the use of drinking water from an improved source that is available with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing. Improved sources include: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the JMP drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services. This indicator is a combination of various components of basic services which on their own are already existing as standalone indicators of the SDGs.
