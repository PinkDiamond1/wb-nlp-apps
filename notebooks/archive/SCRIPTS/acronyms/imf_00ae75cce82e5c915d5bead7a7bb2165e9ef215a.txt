• Discussions on the second review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) 
arrangement were held in Niamey during March 3–17, 2006. The mission team comprised 
Messrs. Rogers (head), Sacerdoti, Farah, and Fontaine, and Ms. Kim (all AFR). The team was 
assisted by Mr. Laporte, the Fund’s Resident Representative in Niger. Mr. Turbat, the World 
Bank’s Resident Representative in Niger, also participated in the discussions. 

• The mission met with the Prime Minister, Mr. Amadou; the Minister of Finance and Economy, 
Mr. Zeine; the National Director for the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), 
Mr. Soumana; and other senior government officials, as well as donor representatives. 

•  The Executive Directors approved the PRGF arrangement in January 2005 in an amount equivalent 
to 10 percent of quota. The first review was concluded in November 2005, at which time Directors 
approved an augmentation of access under the PRGF arrangement to SDR 26.32 million, or 
40 percent of quota to provide additional resources for the government’s food relief program. Upon 
completion of the second review, a disbursement in the amount of SDR 5.875 million would 
become available. 

•  In January 2006, Executive Directors approved debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative (MDRI) in the amount of SDR 77.6 million, including Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 
(HIPC) relief of SDR 17.7 million. In March and April 2006 the IDA and the African Development 
Fund (ADF) provided respectively debt relief to Niger under the MDRI in the amounts of 
SDR 506 million and SDR 54.4 million.  

• All quantitative performance criteria were observed, although two out of five structural 
performance criteria were not met. In the attached letter (Appendix I) the government reports on 
recent developments, sets forth objectives and policies for 2006, and requests waivers and 
completion of the review. 

• Niger is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and shares a 
common fixed exchange rate and external tariffs with other members. The BCEAO conducts 
monetary and exchange rate policies at the regional level. Relations with the Fund and World Bank 
are summarized in Appendices II and III, respectively.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

• After a severe drought in 2004, a strong recovery by the agriculture sector in 
late 2005 improved macroeconomic performance. Real growth rebounded to 
7 percent in light of a record agriculture harvest late in the year. Falling food prices 
helped ease inflationary pressures by end-year. However, food insecurity remains a 
serious concern; an estimated 1.8 million people remain vulnerable to food shortages 
due to losses of livestock and high level of indebtedness incurred during the 2004-05 
drought.  

• The program’s fiscal targets for end-December 2005 were met, owing to higher 
revenue and also because of underspending on food security. The latter reflected the 
limited time available before year-end to commit external budget support disbursed 
late in the year. On structural measures, although two of five performance criteria 
were missed, all related measures have since been implemented except for the 
number of taxpayer audits. The performance criterion pertaining to the domestic 
pricing mechanism for petroleum products was observed; however, retail fuel prices 
were unchanged during August–December 2005, as government deferred petroleum-
based taxes and margin payments to the state-owned petroleum company to stabilize 
domestic prices in the face of a volatile world market.  

• Discussions focused on the 2006 macroeconomic framework, food security needs, 
implementation of priority investment projects, and domestic petroleum pricing 
policy. Real growth is projected to fall to 3½ percent as agricultural output returns to 
trend. Inflation is forecast to be about 1 percent on an end-period basis, reflecting the 
recent decline in food prices. The cost of food security is estimated at 2.7 percent of 
GDP, of which about half is to be covered by additional donor pledges announced in 
a conference held in Niamey in March 2006. The balance would be covered by identi-
fied budgetary resources. The authorities requested support from donors for invest-
ment projects to strengthen food security over the medium term. While donors did not 
commit additional resources, they urged the authorities to include these projects in 
the revised poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) to be finalized by the end of the 
year. Domestic resources will finance some components of these projects in 2006.  

• The revised fiscal program provides for food security needs. The fiscal deficit is 
targeted to be 1.4 percent of GDP above the original program, reflecting higher 
spending on food security. The higher financing requirement is covered by domestic 
financing (including carry over of unspent resources from 2005) and flow debt relief 
provided by the Fund under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The 
revised program includes a number of new measures, including those to strengthen 
fiscal revenue, and a more precise policy for domestic petroleum pricing. 

• Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of two 
structural performance criteria and the completion of the review, given the 
strength of the revised program and the government’s commitment to its timely 
implementation.

I.   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM 

1.      During 2004-05, Niger 
experienced serious social and 
economic challenges. The combined 
effects of drought and locust 
infestation in 2004 resulted in a food 
crisis that affected a quarter of the 
population.  Surging food and fuel 
prices reduced household incomes 
and further aggravated already poor 
socio-economic conditions. In these 
conditions, government attempts to 
remove VAT exemptions in early 
2005 on key food items were met by 
widespread social unrest. In addition, 
avian flu arrived in the country 
during the year. However, the fourth 
quarter of 2005 brought some relief. 
The cereal harvest in late 2005 was 
the largest on record, pushing real 
GDP growth up to 7 percent for the 
year as a whole, and bringing cereal 
prices down close to pre-drought 
levels by early 2006. This eased 
overall inflationary pressure (Table 
2). 
 
2.      The external current 
account deficit remained broadly 
unchanged in 2005, reflecting an 
improvement in the terms of trade. 
Export receipts increased on account 
of higher uranium and gold prices, 
offsetting higher imports partly due to 
increased cost of fuel. The average 
real effective exchange rate 
moderately appreciated in 2005.

3.      All quantitative performance criteria were observed (MEFP, Table 1a). Fiscal 
revenue was higher than programmed, on account of higher trade-related taxes induced by 
more buoyant imports (excluding food relief) and improvements in customs and tax 
administration (Table 3). Overall expenditure was lower than envisaged because of 
underspending on food security, subsidies and transfers, as well as on the Francophonie 
Games. The underspending in the first two categories reflected the limited time available 
before year-end to commit external budget support disbursed late in the year (including from 
the Fund), capacity and coordination constraints within government, and shortfalls in 
external budget support. Immediate need for food security spending was also somewhat 
reduced by the recent good harvest. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit and net domestic 
financing were significantly smaller than programmed.1  
 
4.      Progress in implementing structural reforms was mixed. Three of the five 
structural performance criteria were observed (MEFP, Table 2): (i) the monitoring of the 
performance of main customs offices; (ii) the establishment of joint import verification 
teams; and (iii) the application of the petroleum pricing mechanism. Notwithstanding the 
observance of the latter, domestic fuel prices remained unchanged for August-December 
2005 as the government deferred payment of some petroleum-based taxes and reduced 
margin payments to the state-owned oil importing company (SONIDEP).2 The two structural 
performance criteria related to the turnover threshold for large taxpayers and the 
establishment of an office to carry out issue-oriented audits for medium-sized taxpayers were 
implemented with a delay, except that the targeted number of audits were not completed. The 
authorities explained that this target was overly ambitious given the recent creation of the 
audit office. They were confident that the audits will be completed by the end of the year. 
Further progress was made, with World Bank assistance, on strengthening expenditure 
management and restructuring the financial sector. 
                                                 
1 The program’s fiscal targets would have been achieved even if the authorities had spent the 
entire amount allocated for food security in 2005. 

2 The deferred taxes and margin payments were estimated at CFAF 1.0 billion, with each 
category representing about half of the total.

II.   REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS 

5.      The discussions focused on key macroeconomic policies and objectives for 2006: 
(i) the 2006 macroeconomic framework; (ii) revising the program to incorporate expenditures 
on food security, including, and to the extent possible, previously unfinanced priority 
investment projects; (iii) measures to enhance revenue performance and expenditure 
management; (iv) pricing of domestic petroleum products; (v) the implications of the MDRI 
on debt sustainability and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); and 
(vi) other structural reforms and the PRSP.  
 

A.   Macroeconomic Framework for 2006 

6.      Real GDP growth for 2006 was revised from 4¼ to 3½ percent to reflect the  
return of agricultural production to its trend. Given the recent decline in domestic food 
prices, year-on-year inflation for 2006 is projected at 1 percent. The fiscal and external 
current account deficits are projected to widen as spending on food security increases. The 
BCEAO will continue to conduct monetary and exchange rate policy at the regional level 
with a view to supporting the exchange rate peg and keeping inflation low. The medium-term 
outlook remains broadly unchanged from that in the previous staff report.3

petroleum-based taxes, and 
measures to improve tax and 
customs administration. 
Expenditure will be about 
22 percent of GDP, with all of 
the increase relative to the 
program arising from additional 
spending on food security and 
new priority investment 
projects. The revised program 
is fully financed (including 
with budget support from the 
World Bank, the European 
Union, African Development 
Bank, and France) and 
incorporates debt relief 
provided by the Fund under the 
MDRI.4  With a view to 
streamlining conditionality, the quantitative performance criterion on the basic fiscal balance 
has been eliminated, as it is redundant given the performance criterion on domestic 
financing; however, it remains as an indicative target. 
 
8.      Despite the record cereal harvest in 2005, food security remains a concern. The 
country as a whole has a modest food surplus, but the effects of the drought aggravated 
already fragile socioeconomic conditions and resulted in high household debt levels and 
large losses of livestock. This has hampered the access to food of poor households in some 
areas, and about 1.8 million people (about 15 percent of the population) remain vulnerable to 
food shortages. The authorities are strengthening the capacity to implement the food security 
program with assistance from the World Food Program and other donors. The total cost for 
2006 is estimated at CFAF 51 billion (2.7 percent of GDP). In a conference held in Niamey 
in March 2006, donors pledged to cover some CFAF 30 billion of the cost through financial 
and in-kind support. The 2006 revised fiscal program would cover the balance 
(CFAF  21 billion). If  resources needed for food security are lower than projected, what 
remains could be used to rebuild the national grain reserve up to 100,000 tons, combating 
avian flu, or to reduce domestic financing below the establish targets. 

                                                 
4 The amount of MDRI relief that is spent (the flow relief) is equal to the debt service 
payments to the Fund that were due in 2006 but that now do not have to be paid. Debt relief 
under the MDRI was approved by IDA and the ADF after program discussions were 
concluded, and this relief is not incorporated into the baseline program. The flow relief in 
2006 from the two institutions amounts to CFAF 3.0 billion. The program contains adjusters 
that allow for the spending of this relief on priority programs.

Box 1: The Food Security Situation in Niger 

 
Niger’s food security situation remains a 
serious concern and the authorities have 
developed a plan to address it.  The 
government’s food security program, 
developed with assistance from WFP and 
other donors, is aimed at assisting people 
that are still suffering from the effects of 
the 2004 drought and developing 
contingency plans for future droughts. It 
comprises the reconstitution of the strategic 
cereal reserves, food distribution and 
nutritional support.      

 
In 2006, the cost of the program is 
estimated at CFAF 51 billion. Donors 
pledged thus far CFAF 30 billion in cash 
and in kind, while the balance will need 
to be financed through the budget. The 
proposed program envisages increasing national grain reserves from 15,000 metric tons to 50,000 metric 
tons and providing emergency food relief to 1.8 million people. The government has also reiterated its 
commitment to reconstitute its strategic grain reserves to 100,000 tons by 2007, and is seeking support 
from development partners in this regard.

Food Needs Food Production

 
A critical element of Niger’s security program is to strengthen contingency plans to prepare for the 
effects of recurring droughts. The World Food Program and the Government’s Early Warning System 
and other relevant agencies continue to assess vulnerability to food insecurity so as to guide appropriate 
response.  Further, government plans to work closely with development partners (including the World 
Bank) to incorporate these assessments into programs that would be presented in donor yearly 
conferences that would be synchronized with budget and agriculture cycles from now on.

9.      The revised program incorporates expenditures on priority investment projects 
aimed at improving food security over the medium term. The original program had 
previously contained some CFAF 25 billion (1.3 percent of GDP) of contingent priority 
expenditure (for irrigation projects, an abattoir, restocking the strategic grain reserve, and 
coal mining to increase domestic energy production and reduce the risk of deforestation) that 
would be undertaken if additional donor support could be mobilized. In the 
March conference, donors expressed interest in the proposed projects and encouraged the 
authorities to include them in the PRSP for 2007–09, which should be finalized by end-2006. 
Donors would consider providing financial support in the context of the updated PRSP. 
Meanwhile, about half of the proposed projects are included in the revised 2006 program, 
including all of the amounts sought for rebuilding the grain reserves, with financing coming 
from a better revenue outlook, higher domestic financing relative to the original program,5 
and resources provided by the Fund under the MDRI. The higher domestic financing does 
not have adverse macroeconomic implications because it mainly reflects a run down of 
deposits related to underspending in 2005.   
 

C.   Revenue Administration and Expenditure Management 

10.      Niger has one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 
strengthening revenue mobilization is key to increasing poverty-reducing expenditures 
while ensuring fiscal sustainability. Drawing on Fund technical assistance, the authorities 
are implementing a three-year program to strengthen tax and customs administration. Key 
measures planned for 2006 include: (i) reducing the number of VAT non-filers at the large 
taxpayers office; (ii) strengthening the auditing of large enterprises; and (iii) establishing 
ex-post control of import valuation and exemptions in key border posts. The authorities have 
also committed to sell all the villas constructed for the Francophonie Games through 
transparent public auctions. 
 
11.      Strengthening economic governance is critical for the effective implementation 
of the poverty reduction strategy. The 2004 HIPC Assessment and Action Plans indicated 
that Niger met only 5 of 16 Public Expenditure Management indicators and failed to meet the 
two HIPC criteria on expenditure tracking. Against this background, and in line with the 
2004 recommendations of a Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability 
Review (PEMFAR), key reforms include:6 (i) strengthening the preparation and execution of 
budgetary operations, including through reforms of the Treasury and reinforcing the 

                                                 
5 This will arise from reissuing six-month treasury bills on the WAEMU regional market, and 
drawing down government deposits accumulated in 2005. Treasury bills held by financial 
institutions in other WAEMU countries are treated as nonbank financing.    

6 These reforms are to be supported by a proposed World Bank credit, which will also 
support reforms in rural and social sectors.

collaboration between line ministries and the Ministry of Finance and Economy; (ii) aligning 
budgets with the poverty reduction strategy; (iii) enhancing internal and external controls of 
public financial operations, including through securing additional human and financial 
resources for the office of internal audit and the Audit Office (Champres des Comptes). The 
authorities plan to finalize the medium-term expenditure frameworks for the rural and 
transport sectors by end-2006 and integrate them into the 2007 budget. They will further 
refine, with World Bank assistance, the unified list of priority programs aimed at 
strengthening the monitoring and execution of poverty-reducing programs.  
 
12.      The government is finalizing a medium-term plan to reduce domestic arrears. 
Following the evaluation by the internal audit office of the Ministry of Finance and Economy 
 in December 2005, the stock of domestic arrears is estimated at CFAF 136 billion 
(7.2 percent of GDP);7 a detailed report with proposals on how to settle these arrears has 
been prepared, and is being considered by the government. The bulk of the arrears is towards 
suppliers, and public enterprises and agencies. 
 

D.   Petroleum Product Pricing 

13.      The authorities agreed to adhere to the flexible petroleum pricing system. In 
January 2006 some deferred taxes were recuperated and margins increased.  During 
February-May 2006 the retail pricing mechanism was fully implemented (except for a small 
tax deferment in March), and resulted in significant retail price increases in April and May. 
In the future, the authorities intend to allow a complete pass-through of world prices without 
deferring taxes or margins.8 If world prices fall, domestic prices will not be adjusted 
downward until all previously deferred taxes and margin payments have been collected. The 
government noted that it might revisit this policy, after consulting with the Fund, if sharp 
increases in oil prices were to jeopardize social cohesion.  
 

E.   Debt Sustainability and the Implications of the MDRI 

 
14.      The authorities welcomed the debt relief provided under the MDRI, and the 
additional resources provided by the Fund have been incorporated in the 2006 
program. The proposed program contains adjustors to the quarterly fiscal targets that would 
allow for spending on priority programs of all flow relief provided by IDA and the ADF. 
Relief under the MDRI would significantly reduce debt ratios to levels well below the  
 

                                                 
7 Excluding obligations mostly related to the BCEAO.

policy-based indicative thresholds of the low-income debt sustainability framework.9 A 
prudent external debt strategy will be pursued, including through the strengthening of the 
external debt management unit at the Ministry of Finance and Economy, with assistance 
from donors.  

F.   The PRSP and Structural Reforms  

15.      The updating of the PRSP is advancing, albeit with some delay. Programs for the 
road and transport sector strategy have been costed, and the costing of the programs for the 
rural sector strategy is expected by end-June 2006. This, together with ongoing work to 
strengthen understanding of the country’s poverty profile, should allow the government to 
finalize a revised PRSP in time to discuss it at the proposed donor round table in December 
2006. In the meantime, the government will issue a third annual progress report on the 
                                                 
9 Under the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Rating System, Niger 
is classified as a “medium performer.” The debt sustainability thresholds applied for these 
countries, in terms of NPV of debt to exports, GDP, and revenue are 150 percent, 40 percent 
and 250 percent, respectively.

implementation of the PRSP by end-June 2006. Donors at the March 2006 conference 
reiterated that the PRSP should be the unique vehicle for mobilizing donor financing and 
urged the authorities to work expeditiously to finish the document. They also urged the 
authorities to deepen the dialogue with them and to increase the flow of information 
regarding the implementation of the PRSP in general, and expenditure reform under the 
PEMFAR, in particular. 
 
16.      Deepening financial intermediation and privatizing public utility companies are 
needed to improve economic growth prospects. With assistance from the World Bank, the 
authorities intend to fully privatize Crédit du Niger by end-December 2006, and to complete 
the restructuring of the National Postal and Savings Office. For the latter, the remaining main 
task is to tender 25 percent of Niger-Post’s shares to the private sector. The other banks 
comply with most prudential regulations. The authorities continue to work toward privatizing 
the petroleum-importing and electricity companies with financial and technical assistance 
from the World Bank. 
 

III.   MACROECONOMIC, HUMANITARIAN, AND PROGRAM RISKS 

17.      The macroeconomic outlook and the program are subject to risks. Niger’s 
economy is susceptible to recurrent natural calamities and negative terms of trade shocks in 
the context of a narrow export base. Over the medium to long term, these vulnerabilities can 
be addressed by sustained reforms supported by higher levels of development aid. In the 
immediate future, if the 2006 harvest is substantially below normal, food insecurity would 
intensify and economic growth prospects would deteriorate. Rising world oil prices would 
weaken the balance of payments and put upward pressure on domestic petroleum product 
prices, which could exacerbate social tensions and weaken support for reform. 
 

IV.   STAFF APPRAISAL 

18.      After a drought-induced food crisis during 2004-05, a record harvest in late 2005 
has improved the food security situation and contributed to an economic rebound. 
Consequently inflationary pressures subsided with significant declines in food prices. 
Despite the impact of the drought, all key program measures except one were implemented 
as envisaged or with only a short delay. However, staff regrets the delay in implementing the 
food security program for 2005. Notwithstanding the record harvest, food insecurity is still a 
concern, with a large section of the population vulnerable to food insecurity. 
 
19.      The program for 2006 appropriately provides for additional expenditure for 
food security. The government has already released a portion of these resources to 
strengthen food security. Staff encourages the authorities to work closely with international 
food relief agencies, and to continue to release programmed resources for food security as 
soon as they are needed. The program also provides for resources to initiate the 
implementation of proposed priority investment projects, including those for irrigation, that 
are aimed to strengthen food security and growth prospects over the medium term. The 



- 13 - 

authority’s commitment to work closely with development partners (including the World 
Bank) in implementing proposed projects is welcome. 
 
20.      The fiscal program for 2006 is fully financed by highly concessional donor 
resources, including debt relief provided by the Fund under the MDRI. If development 
partners rapidly supply more food aid than is currently foreseen, the entire amount 
programmed for food security may not be needed. In this regard, staff supports the 
authorities’ decision to use any unspent amounts for faster buildup of the national grain 
reserves, addressing emergencies related to avian flu, and reducing net domestic financing. 
 
21.      A timely implementation of the medium-term revenue mobilization strategy and 
continued commitment to strengthen expenditure management is crucial. Timely 
execution of the revenue mobilization strategy is needed to increase Niger’s low revenue-to-
GDP ratio and meet the expenditure needs associated with the MDGs. The strategy 
appropriately focuses on improving tax and customs administration, addressing tax evasion 
and strengthening informal sector tax compliance. Successful implementation of these 
reforms will require both sustained efforts and a strong political will. On expenditure 
management, the authorities should expedite reforms to strengthen budget preparation and 
execution as well as internal and external controls. These reforms are critical for the 
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy and the mobilization of higher levels of 
development aid. 
 
22.      The authorities’ commitment to use resources provided through MDRI for 
advancing toward the MDGs is appropriate. Debt relief provided under the MDRI will 
substantially reduce Niger’s external debt burden. Nonetheless, the authorities should 
continue to seek financing on highly concessional terms, preferably in the form of grants, to 
enable them to accelerate progress toward the MDGs without undermining debt 
sustainability. In this regard, the staff encourages the authorities to seek assistance from 
development partners to strengthen capacity to manage external debt.  
 
23.      The staff welcomes the authority’s commitment to allow a full pass-through of 
international oil price movements. Staff recognizes the authorities’ concerns about the 
impact of higher domestic petroleum prices on social conditions, which motivated the 
freezing of domestic retail prices during the August–December of 2005 by deferring taxes 
and reducing margin payments to the oil importing company. Nevertheless, given Niger’s 
low revenue-to-GDP ratio and substantial expenditure needs associated with the MDGs, 
lowering or deferring taxes will inhibit the government’s ability to execute its poverty 
reduction strategy.   
 
24.      Staff encourages the authorities to quicken the pace of structural reforms. The 
privatization of the Crédit du Niger and the restructuring of the National Post and Savings 
Institution will help promote financial intermediation and extend financial services in rural 
areas. Staff urges the authorities to advance, with World Bank assistance, the development of 
a privatization strategy for public utility companies.   



- 14 - 

 
25.      Timely completion of the revised PRSP is critical for mobilizing additional 
donor resources. The authorities are encouraged to work with donors to streamline and 
harmonize donor conditionality and to enhance the flow of information. Success in this 
regard will help improve the timeliness of donor disbursements, so as to ensure the full 
implementation of anti-poverty programs and help mobilize additional donor support. 
 
26.      The staff believes that risks to the program are manageable. The economy 
remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, including recurrent droughts. A possible poor 
harvest in 2006 could further weaken food security and reduce economic growth. Concerns 
about food insecurity could be mitigated by rapidly implementing the 2006 program for food 
security and by working closely with relief agencies. The revenue-enhancing measures to be 
implemented in 2006 would reduce risks to revenues related to a drought-induced weaker 
economic growth. Over the medium term, the vulnerability of the economy to terms-of-trade 
shocks and droughts should be addressed by sustained structural reforms to diversify the 
economy and improve its supply response. This will need to be supported by higher levels of 
development aid. 
 
27.      In light of the strength of the program, and the authorities’ commitment to its 
timely implementation, the staff recommends Board approval of the authorities’ 
request for waivers, and the completion of the second review under the PRGF 
arrangement.

Niamey, June 5, 2006 
 
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato 
Managing Director 
International Monetary Fund 
Washington, D.C. 20431 
U.S.A 
 
Dear Mr. de Rato 
 
1.      Niger faced difficult socioeconomic conditions during 2004-2005. A drought and 
locust infestation triggered a food crisis that affected a quarter of the population. A surge in 
food prices, together with higher fuel prices, reduced real incomes and further aggravated 
already weak socioeconomic conditions. Despite these difficult conditions, the government 
satisfactorily implemented policies and reforms envisaged under our PRGF-supported 
program. All the performance criteria relevant for the second review were achieved, except 
for two structural measures for which the government has taken corrective actions. Despite a 
record harvest and an economic rebound in late 2005, food insecurity remains a concern, 
with 1.8 million people requiring emergency assistance. 
 
2.      Against this back drop, the 2006 program, which is spelled out in the attached 
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Polices (MEFP), focuses on advancing our polices 
and reforms to strengthen economic growth and reduce poverty while addressing food 
security needs. The fiscal program has been revised to incorporate a more favorable revenue 
outlook, required food security needs, and key priority investment projects. It envisages 
reforms to strengthen revenue mobilization and expenditure management. The government 
plans also to advance financial sector reforms, the privatization program, and the costing of 
programs underpinning PRSP-based strategies. The latter will underpin a revised PRSP, 
which the government will finalize later in the year.  
 
3.      Accordingly, the government of Niger requests the completion of the second review 
of the PRGF-supported program and waivers for nonobserved performance criteria. As in the 
past, the government consents to the publication by the Fund of this letter of intent, the 
MEFP, the technical memorandum of understanding, and the staff report. In this context, the 
government of Niger believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to 
achieve the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may become  



 - 23 -  

appropriate for this purpose. Niger will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these 
measures and in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in 
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. 
 

Sincerely yours, 
 

/S/ 
 

Ali Lamine Zeine 
Minister of Finance and Economy

ATTACHMENT I 

 
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies  

of the Government of Niger for 2006 
 

I. BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 

1.      The past year has presented Niger with substantial social and economic 
challenges. The combined effects of drought and locust infestation in 2004 resulted in a food 
crisis that affected a quarter of our population. A surge in food and fuel prices reduced 
household incomes and further aggravated socioeconomic conditions. Under these 
conditions, the government’s attempt to remove VAT exemptions on sugar, flour and milk 
resulted in wide-spread social unrest. The periodic closing of borders by our neighbors and 
regional insecurity also disrupted supply lines. However, the fourth quarter of the year 
brought some modest relief. The 2005 harvest was one of the largest on record, pushing real 
GDP growth up to 7 percent for the year as a whole and bringing cereal prices close to pre-
drought levels by early 2006.  
 
2.      Despite the extremely unfavorable environment throughout most of the year, the 
government maintained fiscal discipline while continuing to advance its poverty 
reduction strategy. The economic rebound late in the year, strong growth of imports, and 
improvements in tax and customs administration resulted in revenues that were moderately 
higher than programmed. Expenditure was substantially lower than envisaged, primarily 
because of the short time available at the end of the year to engage additional resources for 
food relief, and also because of delays in obtaining donor budget support. In view of the 
delays and associated cash flow constraints, the government issued six-month treasury bills 
on the regional financial market in April and November. External budget support disbursed 
later in the year was used to retire the treasury bills issued in April. The food security 
program was financed by budgeted resources as well as support by the national and 
international community. In this context, the basic fiscal deficit and domestic financing were 
much smaller than programmed and all quantitative performance criteria for the second 
review under the PRGF were observed (Table 1a). 
 
3.      The three structural performance criteria pertaining to the petroleum pricing 
mechanism, monthly indicators for main customs offices, and institution of joint import 
verification teams were observed (Table 2a). Two other structural performance criteria—
the minimum turnover threshold for large taxpayers, and the establishment of an issue-
oriented audit unit for medium-sized taxpayers—were not met; however, the actions required 
have since been taken, except that we were not able to complete all the audits targeted for the 
audit unit. 
 
4.      On other reforms, the government has advanced the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability 
Review (PEMFAR). In this context, a Treasury-Budget interface (liaison retour) was 
established to improve the monitoring of government expenditure. A unified list of priority 



 - 25 -  

outlays was established in September 2005 and fully incorporated into the 2006 budget, 
facilitating the monitoring of the execution of these programs and evaluation of their 
effectiveness. 
 
5.      We have advanced financial sector reforms and privatization with World Bank 
assistance. The restructuring of the National Post and Saving Institution (ONPE) is 
underway with the establishment during the first quarter of 2006 of separate financial 
(FinaPoste) and postal (NigerPoste) branches. The new institutions will contribute to 
enhanced financial intermediation, given their large nationwide network, and result in a more 
efficient postal service. In the privatization area, the government has completed the financial 
assessment of Crédit du Niger and determined that the government’s net debt to the 
institution amounts to CFAF 1.6 billion.  
 

II. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2006 

A.   Background and Macroeconomic Framework 

6.      Despite the rebound in agricultural production late in 2005, we still face 
substantial challenges in 2006. The effects of the drought and locust infestation persist and 
nearly 1.8 million drought-affected persons remain highly vulnerable. Many households 
exhausted their savings, including selling their livestock, and went into debt to survive, and 
not all regions of the country have experienced increased food production. We are working 
closely with UN agencies, NGOs and donors to implement our food security program and to 
help contain the spread of the avian flu virus (H5N1). We have begun destroying affected 
birds and compensating affected households.  
 
7.      Real GDP growth is projected to slow to about 3½ percent as agricultural 
production returns to its trend. Inflation is projected to ease to less than 2 percent, 
reflecting mainly the recent decline in food prices. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is 
programmed to rise as a share of GDP as we address urgent food security needs. 
Correspondingly, the external current account deficit is also projected to widen and we 
anticipate a small balance of payments deficit. Monetary and exchange rate policy will 
continue to be conducted at the regional level by the BCEAO. The medium-term outlook 
remains broadly unchanged from that contained in our November 2005 Memorandum of 
Financial and Economic Policies (MEFP).  
 

B.   Fiscal policies  

8.      The fiscal program for 2006 has been revised to incorporate a more favorable 
revenue outlook, the carryover of food relief expenditures that had been programmed 
for 2005, some of the priority investment projects identified in our previous letter, and the 
impact of debt relief provided by the IMF under the MDRI. Revenue projections have been 
revised upward from CFAF 205.6 billion to CFAF 210 billion (11.2 percent of GDP) on the 
basis of rebound in economic growth late in 2005, introduction of a new broad based real 



 - 26 -  

estate tax, the collection of deferred petroleum-based taxes, and continued strengthening of 
tax and customs administration. The government is committed to selling all the villas 
constructed for the 5th Francophonie Games and related assets. To advance the process, it 
established by the Decree (No. 0031/ME/F/CAB) of February 21, 2006, a commission to 
assess the value of government investment in the project and to propose a divestment 
strategy. The commission has submitted its report to government. On this basis, government 
has established a commission to sell, through public auctions, the villas and related assets.  
 
9.      The Nigerian authorities are in close contact with development partners to 
obtain financing for the new priority investment projects listed in the 2006 budget law, 
a total of CFAF 20 billion, excluding resources for replenishing national grain reserves that 
are covered under the food security program. These projects are for irrigation, a new 
slaughterhouse, a coal mine, rehabilitation of the housing bank, and establishing a 
specialized agricultural bank. Thus far CFAF 13 billion remains to be identified. These 
projects are consistent with the government’s poverty reduction strategy. The government 
will share with all development partners’ quarterly information regarding implementation of 
the priority investment projects.  
 
10.      Total expenditures are programmed at CFAF 417 billion (22.2 percent of GDP), 
including CFAF 21 billion for the food security program, which we are implementing 
with assistance from donors. This amount includes CFAF 5 billion that was budgeted for 
replenishing strategic grain reserves, which the government plans to increase to 
50,000 metric tons by end-2006 and to 100,000 metric tons by 2007. The government is 
paying particular attention to ensuring that food relief is available in the country in a timely 
manner. Accordingly, we have already disbursed CFAF 5.0 billion in April and another 
CFAF 2.5 billion in May, allowing us to purchase significant amount of cereals. If the full 
amount of CFAF 21 billion is not needed for food security in 2006, the remainder could be 
used to increase the stock of national grain reserves to 100,000 metric tons, addressing the 
emergency related to avian flu, or reducing the quarterly targets of net domestic financing. 
 
11.      The overall fiscal deficit (on a cash basis and excluding grants) would rise to 
11.3 percent of GDP. Net external financing, comprising grants (including debt relief 
provided by the IMF under the MDRI) and highly concessional loans, amounting to 
14 percent of GDP has been identified. Net domestic financing (excluding IMF financing 
through the BCEAO) is targeted at CFAF 7 billion, which we will mobilize by issuing 
government securities and drawing down bank deposits. However, cumulative domestic 
financing over the two program years 2005–06 (excluding IMF financing) will be lower than 
initially envisaged under the program.  
 
12.      Strengthening revenue mobilization is a key element of Niger’s program.  
Accordingly, the Customs and Income Tax Departments of the Finance and Economy have 
prepared medium-term revenue mobilization strategies and associated time-bound action 
plans. Elements of the plans—improving border controls, addressing tax evasion, and 
strengthening informal sector tax compliance—that will be implemented during 2006 



 - 27 -  

include, as performance criteria: (i) the reduction of the number of VAT nonfilers at the large 
taxpayers office (LTO) to a maximum of 5 percent by September 2006; (ii) auditing a 
minimum of 60 large enterprises under the LTO by September 2006; and (iii) establishing 
offices for ex-post control of imports valuations and exemptions in the 3 largest regional 
customs offices by December 2006. Other measures constituting structural benchmarks are 
presented in Table 2b.   
 

C.   External Debt Management  

13.      We will continue to pursue a prudent external debt strategy following the debt 
relief obtained under the MDRI. The implications of the MDRI on external debt 
sustainability will be fully incorporated into our revised poverty reduction strategy, which 
will include a plan for utilizing the debt relief in a manner most effective to reach the 
Millennium Development Goals. To preserve the benefits of the MDRI, we will continue to 
contract debt only with a grant element of at least 50 percent in 2006. To ensure the 
implementation of this policy, the Department of Debt at the Ministry of Finance and 
Economy has been further strengthened, with assistance from donors, through training of 
staff and the provision of equipment. These actions will be followed, with assistance from 
AFRITAC, by preparing a procedure manual for debt management and by further deepening 
staff training on the use of relevant computer software.  
 

D.    Structural Policies  

14.      The government is committed to strengthening expenditure management. In line 
with the recommendations of PEMFAR and with financial and technical assistance from the 
World Bank, the focus is on: (i) improving the preparation and execution of the budget, 
including through strengthened coordination between the Ministry of Finance and Economy 
and line ministries; (ii) strengthening internal and external controls, including through the 
provision of additional financial and material resources to the internal audit office and the 
Audit Office (Champres des Comptes); and (iii) aligning budgets with the poverty reduction 
strategy. Following completion in late 2005 of the medium-term expenditure frameworks 
(MTEFs) for basic education and health, we are now preparing the MTEFs for rural 
development, transport, and secondary education. These will be completed in 2006 and will 
be integrated into the 2007 budget. We will ensure that the MTEFs are consistent with the 
poverty reduction strategy to be updated before end-2006. Further, we plan to finalize the 
costing of the programs for the rural sectoral strategy by end-June 2006. Following the 
comprehensive evaluation completed by our Inspection des Finances in December 2005, the 
stock of domestic arrears is estimated at CFAF 172.3 billion. We have accordingly 
established a repayment schedule for 2006-2007.  
 
15.      The authorities will continue to implement the monthly pricing mechanism for 
retail petroleum products in accordance with the decree of August 2001. During August-
December 2005, we used the mechanism to smooth the impact of the surge in world oil 
prices that occurred during the second half of the year. In particular, the government deferred 



 - 28 -  

some tax payments due and reduced the profit margin of the government-owned oil 
importing company (SONIDEP) to temporarily stabilize retail prices. We recovered some 
deferred taxes in January 2006 when the international oil prices declined and implemented 
the monthly pricing mechanism without tax and margin deferments since then except for 
small deferments in March 2006. In the future, we will adjust domestic retail prices 
downward only after all deferred taxes have been collected. With a view to strengthening the 
national consensus to permit the smooth application of the petroleum retail pricing 
mechanism in place since August 2001, the government will organize shortly a meeting with 
all stakeholders. Henceforth government policy is to continue applying the pricing policy 
established by the decree of August 2001 and to ensure that domestic retail prices reflect 
movements in international oil prices. In case of an emergency situation that would require 
the review of this policy, the government will consult with the Fund concerning the adoption 
of appropriate measures.  
 
16.      The government will continue to advance financial sector reforms with World 
Bank assistance. Consistent with the protocol signed by the government with Crédit du 
Niger (CDN), the government will settle arrears with the bank and accelerate the search for a 
private strategic partner to take over control and management of the bank. The government is 
confident that the rehabilitated CDN will be able to play a central role in boosting residential 
construction and related economic activity.    
 

E.   PRSP Issues and Donor Coordination 

17.      During the March 13–14 donor conference in Niamey, the government 
reaffirmed its commitment to adopting the PRSP as the unique vehicle for mobilizing 
donor support to assist us in achieving the MDGs. We are in the process of updating the 
PRSP for 2007–09, with participation of the civil society and donor community. We will 
issue the final document before convening a round table conference expected in early 
December 2006, at which we will be seeking commitment of financial and technical 
assistance from our development partners. In the meantime, we will issue the annual progress 
report on the implementation of the PRSP during 2004 by end-June 2006. Further, we will 
put in place a framework to better coordinate and harmonize budget assistance with a view to 
streamlining conditionality and improving the flow of information between the government 
and its development partners, especially as regards to the implementation of the 
recommendations of the PEMFAR.  
 

III.   PROGRAM MONITORING 

18.      Program monitoring will be based on quantitative performance criteria and 
benchmarks and quarterly structural performance criteria and benchmarks (Tables 1b 
and 2b). The definitions of performance criteria and benchmarks are provided in the 
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU; Attachment II). With a view to 
streamlining conditionality and enhancing the monitoring of the program, the government 
requests that the quantitative performance criterion on the basic fiscal balance be eliminated, 



 - 29 -  

as it is largely redundant given the performance criterion on domestic financing. Program 
ceilings on domestic financing (net of the position vis-à-vis the IMF) will be adjusted for 
deviations in external budget support relative to program projections. This will allow the 
smooth implementation of priority poverty reducing outlays, and, in the case of higher than 
projected external budget support, permit faster implementation of these programs 
(Table 1b). In case of shortfalls relative to projections in external budget support, the 
quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will be adjusted upward by a maximum of 
CFAF 7.5 billion. In case of higher than projected external budget support, the quarterly 
ceilings on net domestic financing will not be adjusted downward up to CFAF 5 billion. We 
will provide the IMF with the information required to monitor the program in accordance 
with a revised TMU. During the program period, the authorities will not introduce or 
strengthen restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for international current 
transactions without consultation with the Fund, introduce or modify any multiple currency 
practices, conclude any bilateral payment agreements that are incompatible with Article VIII 
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or introduce import restrictions for balance of payments 
reasons.

Technical Memorandum of Understanding 

 
Niamey, June 5, 2006 

 
 

1.      This technical memorandum of understanding updates the definitions of the 
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for Niger’s program under the 
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved by the Executive 
Board in January 2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/79; 03/05). The quantitative 
performance criteria and indicative targets for March, June, September, and December 2006 
are set out in Table 1b attached to the government’s memorandum of economic and financial 
policies (MEFP) dated June 5, 2006. The memorandum also sets out the data-reporting 
requirements for monitoring the program.  

I.   DEFINITION OF TERMS 

2.      For the purpose of this technical memorandum, the following definitions of “debt,” 
“government,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used: 

(a) As specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with 
Respect to Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 
2000, debt will be understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability, 
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of 
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or 
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future 
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities 
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones 
being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender 
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future 
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and 
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under 
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by 
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase 
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts 
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the 
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that 
is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use 
for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total 
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. 



 - 35 - APPENDIX I 
ATTACHMENT II 

 

For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the 
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement, 
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the 
property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially 
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual 
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation 
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not 
give rise to debt. The external debt excludes treasury bills and bonds issued in 
CFA francs on the regional financial market of the West African Economic and 
Monetary Union (WAEMU).  

(b) Government refers to the central government of the Republic of Niger; it 
does not include any political subdivision, the central bank, or any government-
owned entity with a separate legal personality. 

(c) External payments arrears are external payments due but not paid. 
Domestic payments arrears are domestic payments due (following the expiration of 
a 60-day grace period, excluding obligations with a specific grace period and for 
which this grace period applies) but not paid. 

(d) Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government 
verified as such by the government (including any government debt). 

II.   QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 

A.   Net Domestic Financing of the Government 

Definition of the performance criterion 

3.      Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank 
credit to the government, as defined below; (ii) net nonbank domestic financing of the 
government (including government securities issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU 
regional financial market and not held by resident commercial banks) proceeds from the sale 
of government assets, and privatization receipts net of  the cost of structural reforms to which 
these proceeds are earmarked. 

4.      Net bank credit to the government is defined as the balance of the government’s 
claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Government claims include cash 
holdings by the Nigerien Treasury, deposits with the central bank and commercial banks, and 
secured obligations. Government debt to the banking system includes debt vis-à-vis the 
central bank (excluding net financing from the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility 
(PRGF), but including government securities) and to commercial banks (including 
government securities), and deposits with the postal checking system.  

5.      The scope of the net bank credit to the government as defined by the BCEAO 
includes all central government administrations. The targets are based on the variation of 



 - 36 - APPENDIX I 
ATTACHMENT II 

 

stock in net bank credit to the government from December 31, 2005 to the date considered 
for the performance criterion or the indicative target. 

6.      The net bank credit to the government and the net amounts of government treasury 
bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the regional financial market of the WAEMU are 
calculated by the BCEAO, and nonbank financing is calculated by the Nigerien Treasury, 
whose figures are those deemed valid within the context of the program. 

Adjustment  

7.      The quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will be subject to adjustments if 
disbursements of external budgetary support less external debt service and arrears payments 
(excluding net financing from the IMF’s PRGF) exceed or fall short of projected amounts. 
External budgetary support includes resources freed up under the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative (MDRI). External budgetary assistance is calculated from end-December 2005. 

8.      In the event disbursements exceed projected budgetary assistance by up to a limit of 
CFAF 5 billion, the quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will not be adjusted 
downward. The excess budgetary support provided under the MDRI by the IDA and African 
Development Fund can only be used for unfinanced priority projects (irrigation, an abattoir, 
and coal mining) and other priority programs in health, education, and rural sector 
development. If disbursements exceed programmed budgetary assistance by more than 
CFAF 5  billion, the ceilings on net domestic financing will be adjusted downward pro tanto 
by the amount of the excess disbursements beyond the CFAF 5 billion. 

9.      In the event disbursements fall short of projected external budgetary assistance, the 
quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will be raised by a maximum of 
CFAF 7.5 billion. 

10.      In the event government expenditure on the 2006 food security program is lower than 
programmed (CFAF 21 billion), the ceilings on net domestic financing for end-2006 will be 
adjusted downward pro tanto for the unspent amounts unless they are used to fully rebuild 
the national grain reserves up to 100,000 metric tons, or to address emergencies related to the 
Avian Flu. In this case the adjustor will be the difference between the CFAF 21 billion and 
the amount spent for the two uses indicated above.       

11.      Niger’s HIPC Initiative-generated debt-service savings will continue to be transferred 
to a central bank account and used to finance new poverty reduction programs that have been 
approved in the budget law and are in line with the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). 

Reporting requirement 

12.      Detailed data on domestic financing to government will be provided monthly within 
six weeks following the end of each month.  

 



 - 37 - APPENDIX I 
ATTACHMENT II 

 

B.   Reduction of Domestic Payments Arrears on Government Obligations 

Definition of the performance criterion 

13.      Domestic payments arrears on government obligations are reduced through the 
payment of these obligations as defined under paragraphs 2c and 2d above. The government 
undertakes not to accumulate any new domestic payments arrears on government debt as 
defined in paragraph 2 above. For obligations other than government debt, the government 
undertakes not to accumulate arrears beyond six months. The Centre d’Amortissement de la 
Dette Intérieure de l’Etat (CADIE–the government domestic debt-amortization center) and 
the Treasury keep and update the inventory of domestic payments arrears on government 
obligations and maintain records of their repayments. 

Reporting requirement 

14.      Data on the outstanding balance, accumulation, and repayment of domestic payments 
arrears on government obligations will be provided monthly within six weeks following the 
end of each month. 

C.   Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears 

Definition of the performance criterion 

15.      Government debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the government. Under 
the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments arrears on 
government debt (including treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU 
regional financial market), with the exception of external payments arrears arising from 
government debt being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club creditors.  

Reporting requirement 

16.      Data on the outstanding balance, accumulation, and repayment of external payments 
arrears will be provided monthly within six weeks following the end of each month. 

D.   External Nonconcessional Loans Contracted or  
Guaranteed by the Government of Niger 

Definition of the performance criterion 

17.      The government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original maturity of 
one year or more with a grant element of less than 50 percent. Nonconcessional external debt 
is defined as all debt with a concessionality level of less than 50 percent. To calculate the 
level of concessionality for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years, the discount rate to be 
used is the ten-year average commercial interest reference rate (CIRR), calculated by the 
IMF on the basis of the rates published by the OECD; for loans of less than 15 years, the 
six-month average CIRR is to be used.  



 - 38 - APPENDIX I 
ATTACHMENT II 

 

18.      This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the 
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Dept adopted on August 24, 
2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been 
received. However, this performance criterion does not apply to financing provided by the 
Fund, to debt rescheduling in the form of new loans, and to treasury notes and bonds issued 
in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial market. 

Reporting requirement 

19.      Details on any external government debt will be provided monthly within four weeks 
following the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees extended by 
the central government. 

E.   Short-Term External Debt of the Central Government 

Definition of the performance criterion 

20.      The government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original maturity of 
less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 
of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on 
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not 
been received. Excluded from this performance criterion are short-term, import-related trade 
credits and short-term treasury notes issued in CFA francs on the regional financial market.  

Reporting requirement 

21.      Details on any external government debt will be provided monthly within six weeks 
following the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees extended by 
the central government. 

F.  Pricing of Petroleum Products 

Definition of the performance criterion 

22.      The government will continuously implement the monthly retail pricing mechanism 
for retail petroleum products in accordance with the decree of August 2001. From June 2006 
and onwards, in case international oil prices decline, domestic retail prices for petroleum 
products will be adjusted downward only after all deferred taxes during August-December 
2005 have been collected. Otherwise, the pricing mechanism established under the decree of 
August 2001 will be implemented without changes in tax rates or deferment in taxes and 
margin payments to the oil importing company. In case of an emergency situation that would 
require the review of this policy, the government will consult with the Fund concerning the 
adoption of appropriate measures.    



 - 39 - APPENDIX I 
ATTACHMENT II 

 

III.   INDICATIVE TARGETS 

A.   Definitions 

23.      Total revenue is an indicative target for the program. It includes tax, nontax, and 
special accounts revenue, but excludes revenue from the settlement of reciprocal debts 
between the government and enterprises. 

24.      The civil service wage bill is another indicative target of the program. Wage bill data 
are provided by the budgetary accounts and exclude the salaries paid for the reinstatement of 
former rebellion members, the medical and training indemnities, the contributions from the 
budget to the national retirement fund, and the wage refunds. The wage bill includes cash 
vouchers. 

B.   Reporting Requirement 

25.      This information will be provided to the IMF monthly within six weeks following the 
end of each month. 

IV.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM-MONITORING PURPOSES 

A.   Public Finances 

26.      The government will report to IMF staff the following: 
• detailed monthly estimates of revenue and expenditure, including social expenditure 

and the payment of domestic and external arrears;

point corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point 
but not disbursed during the interim period.

 1/ The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provide 100 percent debt relief to eligible 
member countries that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of 
debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004,w which remains outstanding at the time the member 
qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by bilateral contributions and the Fund’s 
own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member under the HIPC 
Initiative. 
 
IX. Safeguards Assessments: 
 
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the 
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. A new safeguards assessment 
of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The assessment found that progress has 



 - 44 - APPENDIX II 

 

been made in strengthening the BCEAO’s safeguards framework of the bank since 2002 
when the last safeguards assessment took place. 
 
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have 
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms have been 
established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and follow-up on internal and 
external audit recommendations has been strengthened. 
 
The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the 
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit 
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the 
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of 
the effectiveness of the internal audit function. 

X. Exchange Arrangements: 
 
Niger is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The 
exchange system, common to all members of the WAEMU, is free of restrictions on the 
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s 
common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the French franc. On January 12, 1994, the 
CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency terms, and the exchange rate was 
adjusted from CFAF 50 = F 1 to CFAF 100 = F 1. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity 
was switched to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1. On April 30, 2006, the rate of 
the CFA franc in SDR terms was SDR 1 = CFAF 772.9. 
 
XI. Article IV Consultation: 

 
Niger is on the 24-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation discussions were 
held in Niamey in April 2004, and discussed by the Executive Board on June 28, 2004.

- 46 - APPENDIX III 

 

Niger: Relations with the World Bank Group 
(As of April 30, 2006) 

 
Partnership in Niger’s development strategy 

1. Niger’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), which was adopted in January 2002, 
presents a thorough poverty diagnosis and identifies key development challenges. The 
Government reconfirmed the main thrust of the PRSP through a second progress report.   
Bank and Fund staff prepared a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) which was discussed at the 
IMF Board in January 2005 and distributed at the Bank’s Board in March 2005. The PRSP 
outlines a sound strategy for poverty reduction centered around four strategic pillars: (i) a 
macroeconomic framework ensuring economic and financial stability while promoting 
sustained and sustainable economic growth; (ii) the development of productive sectors, 
especially in rural areas; (iii) the development of basic social services; and (iv) the promotion 
of good governance and the strengthening of human and institutional capacities. The 
Government has begun using the PRSP to improve coordination of development efforts in 
the country, including donor-supported activities. 

2. A donors’ forum was held in Niamey on June 7-8, 2003. At this forum, donors 
reaffirmed their endorsement of the PRSP as a strategic anchor for their assistance, and 
agreed on a progressive shift from project to program financing, and the need for further 
coordination and harmonization of policies and procedures. In this regard, the signing of a 
protocol relating to coordination among all donors supporting the education sector is a 
positive outcome. The third PRSP Progress Report should be finalized by June 30 after 
comments were provided by the IMF, EU, UNDP and WB in December 2005. The 
Government is behind schedule in the preparation of its second PRSP, which is expected to 
be finalized by end-December 2006. This was as a result of delays registered in launching the 
analytical background papers. The World Bank will mobilize a PRSP trust fund to support 
the preparation of the revised PRSP together with a trust fund intended to foster Gender 
issues in the document. 

Areas in which the Bank leads 

3. Privatization and regulatory reform. Key utility sectors, such as telecommunications 
and water supply have been liberalized and privatized, supported by a Bank credit. However, 
the privatization of the electricity company (NIGELEC) has been delayed mainly due to the 
difficulty in finding private companies ready to invest US$60-100 million required for 
expansion and rehabilitation of the power system. The privatization of the whole sale 
petroleum product distribution company (SONIDEP) has failed in part because of difficulties 
in finding sound foreign private partners interested in investing in Niger. With Bank’s 
assistance, the authorities revisited their objectives and approach in private provision of 
infrastructure. The restructured project seeks to enhance corporate governance agenda for 
selected state owned companies (NIGELEC, SONIDEP) and on the design of a Government 
unit to implement it. The Fund is also a key partner in this policy dialogue and has included 



- 47 - APPENDIX III 

 

elements of the public enterprise reform agenda, such as the continuous implementation of a 
petroleum pricing system.  

4. Rural development. The Bank has provided support for developing and implementing 
a comprehensive rural development strategy, which aims at mitigating vulnerability and 
stimulating income generation, especially in rural areas. A rural development strategy was 
completed in November 2003 and is centered on three pillars: (i) improving the access of 
rural populations to economic opportunities; (ii) protecting rural populations against risks 
and improving food security and managing natural resources sustainability; and (iii) 
enhancing the capacity of public institutions and rural organizations to improve the 
management of the rural sector. Bank assistance in this sector is provided through three 
ongoing operations: Private Irrigation; the Emergency Locust Project aiming  to reduce 
Niger’s vulnerability to ' future desert locust infestations by supporting improved strategies 
for prevention, early warning systems, reactions, and mitigation at both the national and 
regional levels; and Community Action Program. Decreasing the dependence of the vast 
majority of Niger’s population on rain-fed subsistence agriculture is a key objective of this 
strategy. Bank support in this area emphasizes the promotion of small-scale irrigated 
agriculture, livestock, farm and non-farm income-generating activities and cereal bank 
construction. 

5. Social sector reforms. The Bank has assisted the Government in the preparation of a 
ten-year development plan in the education sector (PDDE) that is based on the PRSP and 
includes a medium-term expenditure framework for the basic education sector. It has also 
provided assistance and played a key role in Niger’s eligibility for participation in the 
Education for All—Fast-Track Initiative. In addition, a post primary education study has 
been completed. Improvement of access of the poor to social services is one of the strategic 
pillars in the PRSP. The Bank supports this objective through ongoing lending operations, 
which combine project assistance with program support, as well as analytical work, notably 
on population, gender, and poverty. There has also been close collaboration between the 
Bank and the Government in the design and implementation of reforms in the education and 
health sectors, such as the introduction of decentralized recruitment of teachers (“volunteer 
teachers”) and health workers on a contractual basis. This contractual recruitment program 
has helped address issues of human resource shortages and supply-side constraints while 
keeping payroll costs sustainable. 

6. In the health sector, the Bank has worked with the Government on the preparation of 
the Strategic Orientations for Health Sector Development. In 2002, the Government adopted 
a ten-year health policy strategy (2002-2011). Its main objectives are to further improve 
access to health services (from 47 percent in 2000 to 80 percent in 2011) and to reduce the 
incidence of infectious diseases, by promoting new approaches, including preventive action. 
With a view to make this strategy more operational, the Government has adopted the five-
year development plan for the sector in January 2006. The Bank approved in January 2006 a 
health SWAP of US $ 35million which includes a reproductive health and malaria 
components.  . The RSRC 1 will help the government consolidate and enhance these reforms 
by: (i) improving personnel management and allocations in both sectors; (ii) promoting 



- 48 - APPENDIX III 

 

governance and accountability through information sharing and empowering the community 
in the education sector; (iii) increase access and provision of quality service in both sectors. 
A multi-sector demographics operation is also under preparation. 

7. Poverty monitoring. The Bank worked closely with the Government in preparing a 
poverty profile that served as the basis for the PRSP poverty diagnosis. While this diagnosis 
has been judged as thorough and comprehensive by the joint staff assessment (JSA), it is 
based on household survey data from 1993. Updating the existing database is therefore an 
important concern of the Government. A nationwide census was recently completed, and 
preparations for a new household survey partially funded by the government is scheduled to 
be launched in the second half of 2006. A Demographic and Health survey and the 2005 
Bank financed Core Welfare Indicators Survey (CWIQ) which should be completed by end 
June 2006 will provide updated social indicators most needed for the PRSP update and an 
assessment of progress towards PRSP targets (together with the Country Economic 
Memorandum under preparation). The Bank, together with other donors, is also advising the 
authorities on strengthening institutional arrangements for the monitoring and the evaluation 
of poverty in the context of the PRSP. In addition, the Bank has financed the revision of the 
2001 Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) as a contribution to the Government’s efforts 
to update and strengthen the knowledge base on poverty and social development.  

Areas where Bank and Fund share the lead 

8. Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the 
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to the Government in the preparation of its 
PRSP. Since its completion, both institutions have jointly advised the authorities on the 
refinement and implementation of the strategy. The first and second progress reports on the 
implementation of the PRSP have been prepared with the assistance of the Bank and the 
Fund and both provided comments and advice for the elaboration of the third Progress 
Report expected in June 2006.  

9. Debt sustainability. The Bank and Fund supported the Government’s efforts to reach 
the HIPC completion point in April 2004 with additional relief (“Topping-Up”) granted to 
Niger. The country is still at debt distress as evidenced by the last DSA completed in 
September 2005 conjointly by Bank and Fund staff on end-2004 debt data. Hence, the 
authorities need to pursue sound macroeconomic policies and reforms and prudent debt 
policies (essentially, respecting that all new loans have a minimum grant element of 
50 percent). Niger also benefited of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), but the 
effect will be short-lived as the NPV of debt to exports ratio will raise rapidly from 
58 percent in 2006 to 124 percent by 2025 due to limited internal revenue mobilization 
capacities and huge financing requirements. The need to build technical and institutional 
capacity for managing Niger’s external debt has been stressed by the Fund and the Bank. 
Several measures to strengthen the external debt unit were implemented as structural 
benchmarks under the previous PRGF. Bank and Fund staffs have also supported the external 
evaluation of the use of HIPC resources under the President Special Program. As agreed in 
the Bank’s Public Expenditure Reform operation (PERCG), the government integrated HIPC 



- 49 - APPENDIX III 

 

resources into sectoral programs of HD sectors in 2006 Budget Law and intends to expand 
the measure to rural development ministries upon completion of the rural sector MTEF 
(scheduled for June 2006) and the elaboration of sector Program Budget.  

10. Budgetary and public expenditure reforms. Strengthening public finances is a 
prerequisite for success of Niger’s broader reform agenda. The Bank and Fund share the lead 
in this area. Both institutions have played key roles in helping the Government reduce 
domestic and external arrears. While the Fund is leading the dialogue on revenue-enhancing 
measures, the Bank is concentrating its efforts on budgetary reforms, in particular in the area 
of public expenditure. The Fund is also making key contributions to improving budgetary 
processes: a number of important measures, such as preparation of budget review laws and 
computerization of budgetary expenditure, have been included as structural benchmarks in 
the previous PRGF arrangement. In 2004, the Bank prepared jointly with the Government 
and EU a comprehensive assessment of Niger’s Public Expenditure Management Systems 
and Capacities (Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review: 
PEMFAR). The Bank has supported budgetary reforms through four adjustment operations 
(PEAC I, PEAC II, PERCG and the upcoming RSRC I). Consolidating and deepening these 
reforms (based on PEMFAR priority action plan) is a critical objective of the ongoing RSRC 
I which should be presented to the Board in June 2006. The Country Procurement 
Assessment Report (CPAR) was updated in 2004.  

11. Financial sector reform. The Government launched a comprehensive financial sector 
reform program in 2002. Supported by a World Bank project, the program covers the 
regulatory and legal environment, the banking sector, micro-finance, postal financial services 
and social security.10 Some progress has already been realized. Two commercial banks, BCN 
and BINCI and three insurance companies were restructured and recapitalized.  Audits of all 
major micro-finance institutions have been completed. Restructuring plans for the post office 
have been designed and staff reduction has started. In the next two to three years, measures 
will be taken to improve the legal and judicial environment (modification of legislation for 
the issuing of land titles, improvement of the legal framework for the taking of guarantees, 
training of magistrates, etc.). The Housing Bank (CDN) will be either privatized or liquidated 
by end December 2006; the Community Lending Bank (CPCT) will be restructured. Micro-
finance institutions will be restructured on the basis of the results of the audits, and the 
supervisory unit at the Ministry of Finance and Economy will be strengthened. The post 
office was split into two entities in 2005, Niger Post, for pure mail transactions, and FinaPost, 
a financial services affiliate. Finally, an actuarial audit was conducted of the CNSS, the 
social security institution. 

12. Civil service reform and decentralization. The reform and modernization of the civil 
service is an important element of Niger’s PRSP, yet there has been little progress in this 

                                                 
10  The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan was approved by the Board in February 
2004. 



- 50 - APPENDIX III 

 

area so far. The authorities are currently making an effort to put in place an integrated civil 
service database. By allowing a more transparent and effective management of the civil 
service, this database should improve control over the wage bill. Controlling the wage bill is 
important for maintaining fiscal balance, as recognized by the previous PRGF arrangement, 
which had set quantitative benchmarks for the wage bill. Planning for the implementation of 
the legal framework for political decentralization of 1996 has recently gained momentum. 
The first local elections took place on July 24, 2004. However, important concerns regarding 
this reform remain, such as the lack of capacity at the local level and the fiscal implications 
of decentralization. To help the Government address some of these concerns, the Community 
Action Program will help build capacities in rural communities in planning, implementing, 
and monitoring micro-development projects as well as the upcoming Local Urban 
Infrastructure Development Project.  

Areas in which the Fund leads 

13. Macroeconomic management. The main objectives of Niger’s macroeconomic 
program, as stated in the PRSP, are to ensure economic and financial stability while 
promoting sustainable and robust growth. The Fund is supporting this program through its 
PRGF framework by providing financial and technical assistance, as well as through 
dialogue on macroeconomic policy reforms. The program has made satisfactory progress 
since approval of the first PRGF arrangement in 2000 by achieving most of its benchmarks 
and overall positive fiscal performance. A second PRGF was approved in January 2005 and 
two reviews were successfully completed to date. In the context of the macroeconomic 
framework underlying the PRSP, the Bank has provided technical assistance in building 
capacity in the Ministry of Finance and Economy to monitor economic performance; 
elaborate MTEF and Program Budget in key sectoral ministries (Education, Health ad rural 
Development); and macroeconomic modeling.  

14. Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation is a key objective of the PRGF and is supported by a 
number of performance criteria and benchmarks. Increasing budgetary revenue in order to 
progressively lower the Government’s reliance on external assistance is particularly 
important, given Niger’s low level of revenues, compared with regional partners in 
WAEMU. In terms of expenditures, the Fund is mainly concerned with overall budget 
envelopes, while the Bank focuses on inter and intrasectoral allocations and protection of key 
expenditure items in Education, Health and Rural Development at budget execution phase.  

15. Monetary policy. The Fund leads the policy dialogue on monetary policy, which is set 
by the regional monetary authorities (BCEAO). 

World Bank Group Strategy 

16. The Bank’s new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2003 to 2005 was 
approved by the Bank Board in January 2003. It supports the implementation of the PRSP. A 
new CAS is under preparation.  



- 51 - APPENDIX III 

 

17. As of April 30, 2006, the World Bank lending portfolio in Niger consisted of nine IDA 
active operations, with a total commitment of US$ 255 million, of which $131.5 million is 
undisbursed. IDA assistance has helped reduce the volatility in ODA by compensating short-
term declines in assistance from other partners. IDA has also been responsive to exogenous 
shocks. For instance, an Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP) aiming at fighting the 
locust’s infestation in West Africa was delivered in FY05. A Health sector SWAP and a 
Development Policy lending were delivered in FY 06 (, Board date the DPL which covers 
more than 41 percent of Niger’s 2006 financing gap is scheduled for June 13, 2006).

18. The AAA program helps the Government in areas such as poverty analysis, gender, 
population growth, and sources of growth and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
The AAA program also aims at reinforcing public sector capacity in pursuit of the PRSP’s 
objectives and in preparing Niger for the transition to consolidated programmatic lending. In 
support of these objectives, sector work on population, rural development, Public 
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), CPAR, and 
Participatory Poverty Assessment have been completed. A Country Economic Memorandum 
(CEM) focusing on accelerating growth and achieving the MDGs in Niger is under 
preparation. 

19. The Bank is committed to enhancing external partnerships in the framework of the 
Government’s current efforts to mobilize and coordinate donor support for PRSP 
implementation. Besides the strong partnership with the Fund, the Bank is collaborating with

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Completes the Second Review Under Niger's PRGF Arrangement 
and Approves US$8.7 Million Disbursement 

 
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the second 
review of Niger's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the release of a further SDR 
5.875 million (about US$8.7 million), which will bring the total amount drawn under the 
arrangement to SDR 17.625 million (about US$26.1 million). Niger's PRGF arrangement was 
approved on January 31, 2005 (see Press Release No.05/20) and augmented in November 2005 
(see Press Release No. 05/251). 

The Board also granted waivers for the nonobservance of two structural performance criteria. 

Following the Executive Board's discussion of Niger, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing 
Director and Acting Chair, stated: 

“Despite a good harvest in late 2005 that allowed a rebound of GDP growth and easing of 
inflation, the effects of the 2004 drought continue. There have been large losses of livestock and 
a high level of household indebtedness; moreover, an estimated 1.8 million people remain 
vulnerable to food shortages. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the authorities persevered with 
the implementation of policies and reforms. 
“The revised fiscal program aims at strengthening food security and advancing policies and 
reforms to promote growth and reduce poverty. It accommodates the cost of the 2006 food 
security program, as well as priority investment projects to reduce Niger’s vulnerability to 
droughts. The program incorporates reforms to strengthen revenue and expenditure management, 
which are critical for fiscal sustainability and implementing pro-growth and pro-poor programs.  

“The authorities are committed to using prudently the resources freed up by the Multilateral Debt 
Relief Initiative (MDRI), which will reduce significantly Niger’s external debt burden, to 
advance toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The authorities should continue 
seeking highly concessional financing to safeguard debt sustainability, while strengthening 
further their external debt management capacity. 

“The authorities place a high priority on reforming the financial sector and privatizing public 
utilities. They intend to finalize public sector disengagement from Crédit du Niger, and complete 
the restructuring of the National Postal and Saving Institution.

“A timely revision of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) will be essential for 
mobilizing additional donor support and expediting reforms to strengthen growth and reduce 
poverty. The authorities will work closely with donors in streamlining and harmonizing donor 
conditionality, costing the MDGs, and improving coordination and information flow, to ensure 
timely disbursement of resources for the budget and poverty reduction programs,“ Mr. Carstens 
said. 

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported 
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory 
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are 
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to 
foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are 
repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 

 

 

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Niger 
June 19, 2006 

 
I. Introduction 

 
On behalf of my Nigerien authorities, I would like to convey  their appreciation for the 
constructive relationship with the Fund. In particular, they thank staff for the collaborative 
engagement. Their valuable policy advice has been critical in contributing to maintain the 
PRGF program on track, in spite of the profound social and economic disruptions 
experienced during 2004-05.  My authorities appreciate the analysis on the main challenges 
facing the country over the medium and long term, and they look forward to continued 
dialogue on the policy priorities for the period ahead 
 
As regards the food security situation, drawing the lessons of the last severe food crisis, my  
Nigerien authorities have focused their efforts on assisting people that are still suffering from 
the effects of the 2004 drought and developing contingency plans for future droughts so as to 
react effectively when any food crisis occurs in the future. With the support of the 
international community, steps are being taken to break off from past practices and render the 
economy more resilient to exogenous shocks, especially those related to drought and locust 
invasion. To that end, the government envisages the building of an agriculture production 
system less vulnerable to weather vagaries by promoting the development of important 
irrigation projects and other rural infrastructure aimed at increasing  agricultural production. 
 
While taking steps to strengthen the resiliency of the Nigerien economy, my authorities 
remain committed to preserving the macroeconomic stability as well as promoting a broad-
based growth by exploiting all the economic potentialities set out in the PRSP. Their 
determination to achieve the program’s objectives, despite the fiscal implications of the food 
crisis, has contributed to keep the program on track. In accordance with the staff’s policy 
advice, they are considering the appropriate way to ensure the best use of the debt relief 
provided under the MDRI. 
 
II. Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the Program 

 
The Nigerien economy  experienced a number of adverse shocks in   in 2004-05, including 
drought, locust invasion, high oil prices and avian flu.  These shocks have resulted in a food 
crisis that affected more than 3.4 million people in 2005. Despite the invaluable support of 
the international community and the exceptional hike in agricultural production recorded at 
end 2005, about 1.8 million people are still under the threat of food shortages. The other 
resulting effects of the shocks have been significant a livestock destruction and a drastic 
reduction of household income particularly in rural areas. In many cases, this situation 
compelled the population to increase its private indebtedness in order to meet its food needs.  



 2 

The severe food shortages and higher prices led to violent and growing social unrests 
throughout the country, and placed a severe threat to the still fragile democratic process. As a 
result my authorities were obliged to suspend the removal of VAT exemptions on food 
imports.  

 
Notwithstanding such a difficult social context, my Nigerien authorities remained determined 
to keep the program on track. As a result of their firm engagement, all quantitative 
performance criteria were observed.  Fiscal revenue was higher than programmed, due to 
higher trade-related taxes on account of  larger imports and improvements in  customs and 
tax administration. Overall expenditure was lower than envisaged due, not only to the late 
disbursements of external budget support for food security, transfers and subsidies, but also 
the efforts made by the government to reduce other lower-priority spending, especially those 
related to Francophonie Games.   

 
Turning to structural reforms, three out of the five performance criteria were met. As regards 
the criterion for the application of the petroleum mechanism, the government deferred 
payments of some petroleum-based taxes and reduced margin to the state-owned oil 
importing company with the view to render bearable domestic prices, and to preserve the 
fragile social situation. The two remaining structural performance  criteria were also met but 
with a delay. Regarding the establishment of an office to carry out specific-oriented audits 
for medium-size taxpayers, given that this structure has been already created, the government 
plans to complete the required number of audits by the end of this year.  However, the 
authorities believe that the initial date projected to achieve the audits became not realistic 
given the recent creation of the audit office.  Commendable progress was made, with World 
Bank assistance, on strengthening expenditure management and restructuring of the financial 
sector.   

 
III. The Economic Outlook and Policy  Discussions  

 
For 2006, the macroeconomic outlook shows a growth rate of 3.5 percent of GDP, an 
inflation estimate at 1 percent and higher external and fiscal deficits, reflecting the 
authorities’ priority focused on the need for ensuring food security by increasing related 
spending.   

 
Fiscal policy 

 
On the revenue side, my authorities are implementing a three-year program to strengthen tax 
and customs administration. In this regard, they intend for 2006 to reduce the number of 
VAT non-filers at the large taxpayers office, strengthen the auditing of large enterprises, and 
establishing the ex-post control of import valuation and exemptions in key border posts. 
Many other measures, including the sale of villas built for the Francophonie Games, the 
introduction of a new real estate tax, the collection of deferred petroleum-based taxes, have 



 3 

been envisaged. My authorities expect that these measures will help to raise the revenue-to-
GDP ratio. 

 
Regarding the expenditure side, my authorities’ immediate concern is centered on the need to 
ensure food security, in particular on behalf of the 1.8 million people identified as highly 
vulnerable. Accordingly, the program was reviewed  to take into account  the additional 
costs, including food security needs as well as that of the new priority investment comprising 
irrigation projects, the replenishment of strategic grain reserve and the coal mining. My 
authorities envisage to use the resources drawn from the Fund MDRI to finance those 
projects aimed at improving the food security situation over the medium-term. In order to 
find a definitive solution to the effects of recurring droughts, the government, in 
collaboration with development partners, in particular the World Food Program is working 
towards the elaboration of contingency plans that would be presented to donors for 
assistance. 

 
IV. PRSP and Structural Reforms 

 
The recent food crisis calls for the need to strengthen the resilience of Niger economy to 
shocks, create the conditions of sustainable growth and accelerate the pace of poverty 
reduction as reflected in the PRSP. As prior task to the achievement of these objectives, my 
authorities have put emphasis on the process of updating the PRSP. To that end, they have 
taken steps to finalize by end-June 2006 the third annual progress report on the 
implementation of this important document deemed as the only vehicle for mobilizing donor 
financing. 

 
With regard to structural reforms, my authorities are committed to press ahead with the 
implementation of the reform agenda. In this regard, they intend to give a new impulse to the 
process of deepening the financial intermediation by fully privatizing the Crédit du Niger by 
end-December 2006, and completing the restructuring of the National Postal and Saving 
Office. As regards the electricity and petroleum-importing companies, a new strategy for sale 
is being considering by the authorities with the financial and technical assistance of the 
World Bank. 

 
Aside from the privatization and restructuring reforms as described above, other reforms 
aimed at reinforcing the economic governance are underway. They are focused on the 
following recommendations of  the Public Expenditure Management and Accountability 
Review (PENFAR): (i)  strengthening the preparation and the execution of budgetary 
operations, including through reforms of the Treasury and reinforcing collaboration between 
line ministries and the Ministry of Finance and Economy; (ii) aligning the budgets with the 
poverty reduction strategy; (iii) enhancing internal and external controls of public financial 
operations, including through securing additional human and financial resources for the 
office of internal audit and the Audit Office (Cour des comptes).  



 4 

 
Looking ahead, my Nigerien authorities plan to finalize the medium-term expenditure 
frameworks for the rural and transports sectors by end-2006 with the objective to integrate 
them into the 2007 budget. Likewise, with assistance from  the World Bank, they envisage to 
introduce improvement to the list of priority programs with the aim to ensure a best use of 
the Poverty Reduction resources. The government is also finalizing a medium-term plan 
aimed at reducing progressively the stock of domestic arrears. Given that the preliminary 
assessment shows a significant part of the arrears stock is due to suppliers, my authorities 
expect that the reduction of these arrears will contribute to foster the economic activities.    

 
As regards to the pricing of petroleum products, my authorities reaffirm their commitment to 
ensure a full-pass through in accordance with the decree of August 2001. They underscore 
that the measure to defer some tax and margin payments taken during August-December 
2005 is exceptional and was aimed at avoiding any resurgence of violent social unrests 
experienced during March and April 2005.  My authorities renew their commitment to the 
flexible petroleum pricing mechanism. However,  if new surges in oil prices for which the 
full pass-through could compromise the social stance, the government will consult the Fund 
before undertaking any adjustment of the mechanism. 

 
V. Conclusion 

 
Despite, a very difficult domestic environment, Niger made important progress in the 
implementation of the PRGF-supported program. However,  Niger’s food security situation  
remains a serious concern, and could adversely affect program implementation.  As described 
above, my Nigerien authorities are developing a plan to address the recurrent food crisis. 
They are very grateful for the assistance already provided which has prevented a more 
serious human tragedy, but in their ongoing efforts they  will require the continuous 
assistance of the international community which they hope will be forthcoming. Fund 
support will remain critical in developing and implementing the required macro framework. 
My authorities remain fully committed to the objectives of the program and will pursue 
steadfastly their implementation efforts. In this context,  I would request Directors for their 
support for my authorities’ request of waivers, and the completion of the second review 
under the PRGF arrangement.
