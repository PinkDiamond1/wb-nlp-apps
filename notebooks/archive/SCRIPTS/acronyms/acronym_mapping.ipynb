      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
      "\n",
      "• After a severe drought in 2004, a strong recovery by the agriculture sector in \n",
      "late 2005 improved macroeconomic performance. Real growth rebounded to \n",
      "7 percent in light of a record agriculture harvest late in the year. Falling food prices \n",
      "helped ease inflationary pressures by end-year. However, food insecurity remains a \n",
      "serious concern; an estimated 1.8 million people remain vulnerable to food shortages \n",
      "due to losses of livestock and high level of indebtedness incurred during the 2004-05 \n",
      "drought.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• The program’s fiscal targets for end-December 2005 were met, owing to higher \n",
      "revenue and also because of underspending on food security. The latter reflected the \n",
      "limited time available before year-end to commit external budget support disbursed \n",
      "late in the year. On structural measures, although two of five performance criteria \n",
      "were missed, all related measures have since been implemented except for the \n",
      "number of taxpayer audits. The performance criterion pertaining to the domestic \n",
      "pricing mechanism for petroleum products was observed; however, retail fuel prices \n",
      "were unchanged during August–December 2005, as government deferred petroleum-\n",
      "based taxes and margin payments to the state-owned petroleum company to stabilize \n",
      "domestic prices in the face of a volatile world market.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Discussions focused on the 2006 macroeconomic framework, food security needs, \n",
      "implementation of priority investment projects, and domestic petroleum pricing \n",
      "policy. Real growth is projected to fall to 3½ percent as agricultural output returns to \n",
      "trend. Inflation is forecast to be about 1 percent on an end-period basis, reflecting the \n",
      "recent decline in food prices. The cost of food security is estimated at 2.7 percent of \n",
      "GDP, of which about half is to be covered by additional donor pledges announced in \n",
      "a conference held in Niamey in March 2006. The balance would be covered by identi-\n",
      "fied budgetary resources. The authorities requested support from donors for invest-\n",
      "ment projects to strengthen food security over the medium term. While donors did not \n",
      "commit additional resources, they urged the authorities to include these projects in \n",
      "the revised poverty reduction strategy paper  to be finalized by the end of the \n",
      "year. Domestic resources will finance some components of these projects in 2006.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• The revised fiscal program provides for food security needs. The fiscal deficit is \n",
      "targeted to be 1.4 percent of GDP above the original program, reflecting higher \n",
      "spending on food security. The higher financing requirement is covered by domestic \n",
      "financing (including carry over of unspent resources from 2005) and flow debt relief \n",
      "provided by the Fund under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative . The \n",
      "revised program includes a number of new measures, including those to strengthen \n",
      "fiscal revenue, and a more precise policy for domestic petroleum pricing. \n",
      "\n",
      "• Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of two \n",
      "structural performance criteria and the completion of the review, given the \n",
      "strength of the revised program and the government’s commitment to its timely \n",

      "1.      Niger faced difficult socioeconomic conditions during 2004-2005. A drought and \n",
      "locust infestation triggered a food crisis that affected a quarter of the population. A surge in \n",
      "food prices, together with higher fuel prices, reduced real incomes and further aggravated \n",
      "already weak socioeconomic conditions. Despite these difficult conditions, the government \n",
      "satisfactorily implemented policies and reforms envisaged under our PRGF-supported \n",

      "for two structural measures for which the government has taken corrective actions. Despite a \n",
      "record harvest and an economic rebound in late 2005, food insecurity remains a concern, \n",
      "with 1.8 million people requiring emergency assistance. \n",
      " \n",
      "2.      Against this back drop, the 2006 program, which is spelled out in the attached \n",
      "Memorandum of Economic and Financial Polices (MEFP), focuses on advancing our polices \n",
      "and reforms to strengthen economic growth and reduce poverty while addressing food \n",
      "security needs. The fiscal program has been revised to incorporate a more favorable revenue \n",
      "outlook, required food security needs, and key priority investment projects. It envisages \n",
      "reforms to strengthen revenue mobilization and expenditure management. The government \n",
      "plans also to advance financial sector reforms, the privatization program, and the costing of \n",
      "programs underpinning PRSP-based strategies. The latter will underpin a revised PRSP, \n",
      "which the government will finalize later in the year.  \n",

      "past, the government consents to the publication by the Fund of this letter of intent, the \n",

      "\n",
      "1.      The past year has presented Niger with substantial social and economic \n",
      "challenges. The combined effects of drought and locust infestation in 2004 resulted in a food \n",
      "crisis that affected a quarter of our population. A surge in food and fuel prices reduced \n",
      "household incomes and further aggravated socioeconomic conditions. Under these \n",
      "conditions, the government’s attempt to remove VAT exemptions on sugar, flour and milk \n",
      "resulted in wide-spread social unrest. The periodic closing of borders by our neighbors and \n",
      "regional insecurity also disrupted supply lines. However, the fourth quarter of the year \n",
      "brought some modest relief. The 2005 harvest was one of the largest on record, pushing real \n",
      "GDP growth up to 7 percent for the year as a whole and bringing cereal prices close to pre-\n",
      "drought levels by early 2006.  \n",
      " \n",

      "I. Introduction \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "On behalf of my Nigerien authorities, I would like to convey  their appreciation for the \n",
      "constructive relationship with the Fund. In particular, they thank staff for the collaborative \n",
      "engagement. Their valuable policy advice has been critical in contributing to maintain the \n",
      "PRGF program on track, in spite of the profound social and economic disruptions \n",
      "experienced during 2004-05.  My authorities appreciate the analysis on the main challenges \n",
      "facing the country over the medium and long term, and they look forward to continued \n",
      "dialogue on the policy priorities for the period ahead \n",
      " \n",
      "As regards the food security situation, drawing the lessons of the last severe food crisis, my  \n",
      "Nigerien authorities have focused their efforts on assisting people that are still suffering from \n",
      "the effects of the 2004 drought and developing contingency plans for future droughts so as to \n",
      "react effectively when any food crisis occurs in the future. With the support of the \n",
      "international community, steps are being taken to break off from past practices and render the \n",
      "economy more resilient to exogenous shocks, especially those related to drought and locust \n",
      "invasion. To that end, the government envisages the building of an agriculture production \n",
      "system less vulnerable to weather vagaries by promoting the development of important \n",
      "irrigation projects and other rural infrastructure aimed at increasing  agricultural production. \n",
      " \n",
      "While taking steps to strengthen the resiliency of the Nigerien economy, my authorities \n",
      "remain committed to preserving the macroeconomic stability as well as promoting a broad-\n",
      "based growth by exploiting all the economic potentialities set out in the PRSP. Their \n",
      "determination to achieve the program’s objectives, despite the fiscal implications of the food \n",
      "crisis, has contributed to keep the program on track. In accordance with the staff’s policy \n",
      "advice, they are considering the appropriate way to ensure the best use of the debt relief \n",

      "II. Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the Program \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The Nigerien economy  experienced a number of adverse shocks in   in 2004-05, including \n",
      "drought, locust invasion, high oil prices and avian flu.  These shocks have resulted in a food \n",
      "crisis that affected more than 3.4 million people in 2005. Despite the invaluable support of \n",
      "the international community and the exceptional hike in agricultural production recorded at \n",
      "end 2005, about 1.8 million people are still under the threat of food shortages. The other \n",
      "resulting effects of the shocks have been significant a livestock destruction and a drastic \n",
      "reduction of household income particularly in rural areas. In many cases, this situation \n",
      "compelled the population to increase its private indebtedness in order to meet its food needs.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The severe food shortages and higher prices led to violent and growing social unrests \n",
      "throughout the country, and placed a severe threat to the still fragile democratic process. As a \n",
      "result my authorities were obliged to suspend the removal of VAT exemptions on food \n",
      "imports.  \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Notwithstanding such a difficult social context, my Nigerien authorities remained determined \n",
      "to keep the program on track. As a result of their firm engagement, all quantitative \n",
      "performance criteria were observed.  Fiscal revenue was higher than programmed, due to \n",
      "higher trade-related taxes on account of  larger imports and improvements in  customs and \n",
      "tax administration. Overall expenditure was lower than envisaged due, not only to the late \n",
      "disbursements of external budget support for food security, transfers and subsidies, but also \n",
      "the efforts made by the government to reduce other lower-priority spending, especially those \n",
      "related to Francophonie Games.   \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Turning to structural reforms, three out of the five performance criteria were met. As regards \n",
      "the criterion for the application of the petroleum mechanism, the government deferred \n",
      "payments of some petroleum-based taxes and reduced margin to the state-owned oil \n",
      "importing company with the view to render bearable domestic prices, and to preserve the \n",
      "fragile social situation. The two remaining structural performance  criteria were also met but \n",
      "with a delay. Regarding the establishment of an office to carry out specific-oriented audits \n",
      "for medium-size taxpayers, given that this structure has been already created, the government \n",
      "plans to complete the required number of audits by the end of this year.  However, the \n",
      "authorities believe that the initial date projected to achieve the audits became not realistic \n",
      "given the recent creation of the audit office.  Commendable progress was made, with World \n",

      "For 2006, the macroeconomic outlook shows a growth rate of 3.5 percent of GDP, an \n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
