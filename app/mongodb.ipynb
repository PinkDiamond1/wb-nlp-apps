      "general or nonlife insurance and life insurance. The primary function\n",
      "of all insurance business is to provide protection against financial\n",
      "loss from predictable, but uncerxain, events.  Because they accumulate\n",

      "losses caused by various hazards, such as fire and theft. By offering\n",
      "risk-sharing artangements, they can enhance the efficiency of trade and\n",
      "industry as well as consumer welfare. At the cost of a small premium\n",

      "policyholders can protect themselves from the financial consequences of\n",
      "losses resulting from particular accidents.\n",
      "7.3         General insurance companies provide coverage that is limited\n",
      "to short periods, normally not more than a year. The limited term of\n",
      "general policies is dictated by the difficulty of assessing the\n",
      "probability of losses over periods longer than a year. This is related\n",
      "both to the cyclical nature of losses and to the uncertain impact of\n",
      "inflation on total losses. In some lines where risk assessment is very\n",
      "difficult, such as in motor insurance for young drivers, insurance\n",
      "policies may even be limited to three months.\n",
      "7.4         As a result of the short-term nature of their policies, the\n",
      "technical reserves of general insurance business are only a fraction of\n",
      "annual premiums and make little contribution to the generation of long-\n",
      "term financial savings. General insurance reserves must be kept in\n",

      "the risk of premature death and the risk of excessive longevity. The\n",
      "former is covered by various life policies, such as whole life and term\n",
      "insurance, while the latter is covered by annuities. Life insurance\n",
      "companies also provide an efficient means for saving. This is covered\n",

      "ownership (Annex VII.1.)\n",
      "7.61        The general rise in expenses throughout the market is in\n",

      "The Rationale for Insurance Regulation\n",
      "7.63        Like banks, insurance companies may be subject to extensive\n",
      "regulations. Some regulations aim to correct for various market\n",
      "imperfections and are, for this reason, desirable. For instance,\n",

      "return government securities or high priority activities.\n",
      "7.64        Close insurance regulation and supervision are justified by\n",
      "the high information costs associated with insurance products.\n",
      "Insurance products are contractual undertakings to pay a certain sum of\n",
      "money when a loss-producing event occurs. Insurance contracts are\n",
      "complex because they have to specify the nature of the loss-producing\n",
      "event and the circumstances under which its occurrence would trigger a\n",
      "payment under the contract; they also must determine the amount to be\n",
      "paid and specify the responsibilities of the insured, in terms of the\n",
      "level of premiums to be paid, any risk sharing arrangements, such as co-\n",
      "insurance and deductibles, the disclosure of material information, and\n",
      "any actions that are required to reduce the risk of loss.\n",
      "7.65        High information costs arise from three main sources:  (i)\n",
      "the complexity of contractual terms and conditions of coverage that put\n",
      "consumers at a considerable disadvantage against insurance companies and\n",
      "their agents; (ii) the wide variety of risk characteristics of the\n",
      "insured that cause problems for both consumers and insurance companies;\n",
      "and (iii) the difficulty of assessing the financial solvency of\n",
      "insurers. These areas are closely interrelated. For instance,\n",
      "variations in risk characteristics may result in product differentiation\n",
      "that increases the complexity of insurance contracts and makes them\n",
      "difficult to compare, especially for nonprofessional consumers.\n",
      "7.66        The need to deal with the problems of adverse selection and\n",

      "however, easily understood by the public at large. Moreover, they are\n",
      "often written in arcane language and hidden in the fine print of\n",
      "insurance policies. Thus, when insurance companies reject claims on the\n",
      "grounds that they are not covered, policyholders accuse insurance\n",
      "companies of seeking excuses to renege on their contractual obligations.\n",
      "7.67        The use of standardized contracts may reduce the level of\n",

      "7.68        Concern for the financial solvency of insurers stems from\n",

      "of supplementary benefits. In most countries, the first occupational\n",
      "pension plans were set up to cover civil servants and military\n",
      "personnel, mostly on an unfunded basis, but the concept was later\n",

      "argued that the higher costs reflect a necessary segmentation of the\n",
      "market. In life insurance, market segmentation by risk characteristic\n",
      "is accepted as rational and desirable behavior on the part of insurers;\n",
      "it is difficult to see why in life annuities the same approach should be\n",
      "seen as involving \"actuarially unfair\" prices.\n",
      "10.7        A second, and a more important, reason for the\n",
      "underdevelopment of the private annuity market may be that people are\n",

      "distribution. Only a comprehensive program of reform that takes into\n",
      "consideration all of these related factors would provide a significant\n",
      "and unambiguous contribution to the development of the Egyptian economy.\n",
      "In contrast, a narrowly focused approach -- simply introducing a forced\n",
      "saving scheme -- might worsen conditions in labor and financial markets.\n",
      "The proposal presented here aims at a comprehensive, rather than a\n",
      "narrow, reform.\n",
      "11.2        This chapter describes an integrated set of proposals to\n",

      "reforms primarily involve wage and salary workers in the formal sector.\n",
      "The aocial insurance programs that protect these workers are the most\n",

      "interest rates and increase the efficiency with which domestic savings\n",
      "are allocated and mobilized.\n",
      "11.4        An important philosophy underlying the reform is that the\n",
      "Government should not use more than one or two specific policies to\n",
      "redistribute income. Introducing redistribution into each and every\n",
      "government program is a prescription for cumbersome, inefficient and\n",
      "overly complex programs. Also, encouraging excessive labor movement\n",
      "from the formal to the informal sector and deterring mobility within the\n",
      "formal sector should be avoided.\n",
      "11.5        Another philosophy underlying the reform is that a publicly\n",
      "managed social insurance system must play a central role in assuring\n",
      "adequate retirement incomes for low- and average-wage workers. Because\n",
      "this function involves redistribution between poorly paid and well-paid\n",
      "workers, a compulsory public role is essential. Moreover, a purely\n",
      "private contributory system could not guarantee adequate retirement\n",
      "incomes to low-wage workers because of the uncertainty of long-run real\n",
      "returns in private capital markets. At the same time, a supplementary\n",
      "private pension system could provide an ideal vehicle for providing\n",
      "adequate retirement incomes to highly compensated employees. Finally, a\n",
      "prudently supervised private pension system could contribute to the\n",
      "development of modern capital markets in Egypt.\n",
      "11.6        Many countries have implemented plans with objectives\n",
      "similar to those stated above, though the methodologies have differed\n",
      "from country to country. The changes that Egypt could adopt range from\n",
      "revising its current social insurance system, without altering its\n",
      "defined betiefit character, to gradually phasing out the system and\n",

      "contributions and benefits under the supplementary private pension is\n",
      "very straightforward. By strengthening the link between contributions\n",
      "and benefits, the proposed scheme improves economic efficiency. If a\n",
      "worker perceives that benefits are unrelated to contributions, the\n",
      "contribution is equivalent to a pure tax on labor earnings, driving a\n",

      "6.1         Like governments in most other  iveloped and developing\n",
      "countries, the Egyptian authorities are engaging in a fundamental re-\n",
      "writing of the ground rules goveining banking operations. At one level,\n",
      "they are undertaking the elimination or substantial relaxation of\n",
      "economic ard structural regulations, such as interest rate and credit\n",
      "controls and restrictions on market entry and diversification. At\n",
      "another level, they are placing a growing emphasis on prudential and\n",
      "protective regulations that are deemed essential for the smooth and\n",
      "efficient functioning of banking and financial systems.1\n",
      "6.2         In continuing the trend of strengthening prudential\n",
      "regulation and levelling the playing field for banks, recent amendments\n",
      "to the banking law, promulgated on June 4, 1992, made a number of\n",
      "significant changes:\n",
      "a.    Foreign banks can open \"representative\" offices and\n",
      "establish joint-stock subsidiaries that are permitted to\n",
      "deal in local currency;\n",
      "b.    New minimum capital requirements have been established for\n",
      "banks and foreign bank branches and the CBE can require\n",
      "increases in a bank's capital and bank mergers if banks are\n",
      "exposed to financial problems;\n",
      "C.    A \"deposit insurance fund\" has been created as a juridical\n",
      "person having its own budget and sanctions can be taken by\n",
      "the deposit insurance fund ag-.inst member banks which\n",
      "violate its articles of association or decrees;\n",
      "d.    A \"banking institute\" has been created with the status of a\n",
      "juridical person and with its own budget. In addition,\n",
      "banks may form a \"bankers' association\" to upgrade the\n",
      "quality of banking and encourage healthy competition within\n",
      "the banking sector. In this regard, the CBE may vest the\n",
      "banks with the freedom to determlne their own rates of\n",
      "return on banking operations;\n",
      "e.    The CBE may remove members of the board of directors and\n",
      "senior managers of banks who engage in unsafe or unsound\n",

      "general or nonlife insurance and life insurance. The primary function\n",
      "of all insurance business is to provide protection against financial\n",
      "loss from predictable, but uncerxain, events.  Because they accumulate\n",
      "technical reserves and other fundo to meet their obligations from future\n",

      "resources.\n",
      "7.2         General insurance companies provide financial protection to\n",
      "industrial and commercial companies as well as to households from the\n",
      "losses caused by various hazards, such as fire and theft. By offering\n",
      "risk-sharing artangements, they can enhance the efficiency of trade and\n",
      "industry as well as consumer welfare. At the cost of a small premium\n",
      "relative to their risk exposure (the insured amount of their policies),\n",
      "policyholders can protect themselves from the financial consequences of\n",
      "losses resulting from particular accidents.\n",
      "7.3         General insurance companies provide coverage that is limited\n",
      "to short periods, normally not more than a year. The limited term of\n",
      "general policies is dictated by the difficulty of assessing the\n",
      "probability of losses over periods longer than a year. This is related\n",
      "both to the cyclical nature of losses and to the uncertain impact of\n",
      "inflation on total losses. In some lines where risk assessment is very\n",
      "difficult, such as in motor insurance for young drivers, insurance\n",
      "policies may even be limited to three months.\n",
      "7.4         As a result of the short-term nature of their policies, the\n",
      "technical reserves of general insurance business are only a fraction of\n",
      "annual premiums and make little contribution to the generation of long-\n",
      "term financial savings. General insurance reserves must be kept in\n",
      "liquid form and are ideally suited for investment in short-term\n",
      "marketable securities, such as treasury bills and commercial paper.\n",
      "Thus, general insurance companies can play an active part in supporting\n",

      "7.5         Life insurance companies cover two types of personal risks:\n",
      "the risk of premature death and the risk of excessive longevity. The\n",
      "former is covered by various life policies, such as whole life and term\n",
      "insurance, while the latter is covered by annuities. Life insurance\n",
      "companies also provide an efficient means for saving. This is covered\n",
      "by various types of endowment policies that include traditional policies\n",

      "generate any long-term savings, most types of life insurance policies\n",
      "contribute significantly to the accumulation of technical reserves and\n",
      "other long-term funds. Their investable funds, arising both from the\n",
      "creation of technical reserves and the reinvestment of profits to the\n",

      "of the hottest debates in the area of public economics. Under one view,\n",
      "the SIS, companty pension funds and life insurance policies represent a\n",

      "that pension systems, even though they include survivorship benefits,\n",

      "11.1        As discussed in the previous chapters, contractual savings\n",
      "economics involves a wide array of issues, including the tax treatment\n",
      "of insurance and pension plans, the regulation and supervision of CSIs\n",
      "and the effects on public finance, labor markets and income\n",
      "distribution. Only a comprehensive program of reform that takes into\n",
      "consideration all of these related factors would provide a significant\n",
      "and unambiguous contribution to the development of the Egyptian economy.\n",
      "In contrast, a narrowly focused approach -- simply introducing a forced\n",
      "saving scheme -- might worsen conditions in labor and financial markets.\n",
      "The proposal presented here aims at a comprehensive, rather than a\n",
      "narrow, reform.\n",
      "11.2        This chapter describes an integrated set of proposals to\n",
      "reform the social insurance system and private pensions in Egypt. The\n",
      "reforms primarily involve wage and salary workers in the formal sector.\n",
      "The aocial insurance programs that protect these workers are the most\n",
      "significant in the country. Workers in other sectors, where information\n",
      "about labor incomes is less relia-le, would continue to receive social\n",
      "insurance under separate systems.\n",
      "11.3        The main goals of reform are to:\n",
      "(i)         improve the efficiency and equity of the overall\n",
      "pension system;\n",
      "(ii)        provide covered workers with old-age, disability, and\n",

      "interest rates and increase the efficiency with which domestic savings\n",
      "are allocated and mobilized.\n",
      "11.4        An important philosophy underlying the reform is that the\n",
      "Government should not use more than one or two specific policies to\n",
      "redistribute income. Introducing redistribution into each and every\n",
      "government program is a prescription for cumbersome, inefficient and\n",
      "overly complex programs. Also, encouraging excessive labor movement\n",
      "from the formal to the informal sector and deterring mobility within the\n",
      "formal sector should be avoided.\n",
      "11.5        Another philosophy underlying the reform is that a publicly\n",
      "managed social insurance system must play a central role in assuring\n",
      "adequate retirement incomes for low- and average-wage workers. Because\n",
      "this function involves redistribution between poorly paid and well-paid\n",
      "workers, a compulsory public role is essential. Moreover, a purely\n",
      "private contributory system could not guarantee adequate retirement\n",
      "incomes to low-wage workers because of the uncertainty of long-run real\n",
      "returns in private capital markets. At the same time, a supplementary\n",
      "private pension system could provide an ideal vehicle for providing\n",
      "adequate retirement incomes to highly compensated employees. Finally, a\n",
      "prudently supervised private pension system could contribute to the\n",
      "development of modern capital markets in Egypt.\n",
      "11.6        Many countries have implemented plans with objectives\n",
      "similar to those stated above, though the methodologies have differed\n",
      "from country to country. The changes that Egypt could adopt range from\n",
      "revising its current social insurance system, without altering its\n",
      "defined betiefit character, to gradually phasing out the system and\n",

      "II. Outline of Basic System\n",
      "11.7        For wage and salary workers in the formal sector, the\n",

      "scheme that offers extremely inadequate insurance on wages above LE 250\n",
      "p.m.; and (c) purely voluntary private scheme that provides supplemental\n",
      "prot,ction to a minority of mostly well-compensated workers. A very\n",
      "small number of workers are enrolled in private schemes that fully or\n",
      "partially replace the first two (public) elements in this overall\n",
      "system.\n",
      "11.8        The reformed system would include three pillars to assure\n",
      "adequate retirement incomes: (a) a basic, fully-funded DB public scheme\n",
      "thav insures workers' earnings up to a moderate (but presently\n",
      "undetermined) level; (b) a new funded compulsory private system that\n",
      "insures workers' wages above this moderate level through DC private\n",
      "pensions; and (c) a purely voluntary private scheme that could\n",
      "supplement the pensions and insurance provided under the first two\n",
      "compulsory programs. The systems under (b) and (c), although privately\n",
      "managed, would be publicly supervised. The small number of formal-\n",
      "sector workers, who are presently insured under alternative\n",
      "(replacement) private schemes, would be forced to enroll in the\n",
      "compulsory public and private insurance systems.1 The present\n",
      "supplementary public system, which insures workers' variable wages,\n",
      "would be phased out altogether. We do not propose including self-\n",
      "employed workers or Egyptians working abroad in the reformed public\n",
      "system at the current time. These workers are already covered by other\n",
      "public programs and should probably continue to be covered under those\n",
      "programs until reliable methods can be devised to measure their annual\n",
      "earnings.2 However, we would encourage the Egyptian authorities to\n",
      "provide the opportunity for self-employed workers and Egyptians working\n",
      "abroad to participate in the private schemes.\n",
      "11.9        One other change in the current social insurance system is\n",
      "also recommended. The end-of-service indemnities should be funded\n",
      "outside the public social insurance system. Since these indemnities are\n",
      "strictly proportional to workers' wages and creditable years of service,\n",
      "they involve no significant redistribution between workers. There is,\n",
      "thus, no strong argument for government involvement in funding the\n",

      "indemnities. They could be financed as part of the private pension\n",

      "the formal sector. In either case, the liabilities should be funded as\n",
      "they accrue, and employers should set aside real reserves to pay for the\n",
      "liabilities, possibly in funds managed by the same private organizations\n",
      "that administer the private pension plans.\n",
      "11.10       Under the reformed system, the public social insurance\n",
      "system would continue to be responsible for assuring minimum retirement\n",
      "incomes, but the new private compulsory pension scheme would assume\n",
      "responsibility for providing adequate retirement incomes to well-paid\n",
      "and highly compensated workers. As under the current basic system, the\n",
      "public system would offer defined-benefit pensions under a formula that\n",
      "contains a relatively generous minimum pension for workers who have\n",

      "employer pension funds or as part of larger, multi-employer funds. The\n",
      "funds would be managed outside the present public social insurance\n",
      "system, although they would be subject to strict regulation and public\n",
      "supervision to guarantee their safety.   Workers, or their\n",
      "beneficiaries, would receive their contributions plus all accumulated\n",
      "returns upon retirement, disability or death. The payment could be\n",
      "received in the form of an annuity or as part of a package that includes\n",
      "a lump-sum distribution, as well as an annuity.\n",
      "11.12       Both the basic public pension, as well as the compulsory\n",
      "private pension, should be portable across employers in the formal\n",
      "sector. Vesting in the public social insurance pension would require\n",
      "contributions over a minimum number of years, while vesting in the\n",
      "defined-contribution private pension plar. would be immediate. Workers\n",
      "who leave covered employment in the formal sector should be prevented\n",
      "from withdrawing their contributions from the public and private plans\n",
      "until they attain the normal retirement age or become disabled. The\n",
      "purpose of pension contributions is to insure workers against the loss\n",
      "of earnings due to old age, disability or death. Hence, contributions\n",
      "into the funds should continue to accumulate until one of these events\n",
      "occurs.\n",
      "III. Advantages of the Reformed System\n",
      "11.13       The proposed reform offers several advantages over the\n",
      "current Egyptian system. First, the new system is much more transparent\n",
      "than the existing system. It is clearly the responsibility of :he\n",
      "public system to provide minimum retirement incomes, as it is -he\n",
      "responsibility of the private scheme to provide earnings-related\n",
      "pensions to highly compensated workers. Second, the link between\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "\n",
      "- 159 -\n",
      "contributions and eventual benefits is also much clearer. Benefits\n",
      "under the reformed pension formula would directly depend on average\n",
      "covered wages and years of covered service. The connection between\n",
      "contributions and benefits under the supplementary private pension is\n",
      "very straightforward. By strengthening the link between contributions\n",
      "and benefits, the proposed scheme improves economic efficiency. If a\n",
      "worker perceives that benefits are unrelated to contributions, the\n",
      "contribution is equivalent to a pure tax on labor earnings, driving a\n",
      "distortionary wedge between the output of workers and the marginal\n",
      "reward to working. This distortion can be especially burdensome in a\n",
      "labor market with a large informal sector, wbere the tax can be avoided.\n",
      "If the tax can be avoided in an uncovered sector, workers are provided\n",
      "with a strong incentive to find employment in that sector, and employers\n",
      "are provided with an equally strong inducement to create employment\n",
      "opportunities there. The DC program provides a clear link between\n",
      "contributions and benefits, increasing the likelihood that workers will\n",
      "perceive the contribution as part of deferred compensation rather than\n",
      "as a tax. Thus, the reform raises the attractiveness of employment in\n",
      "the formal, social-insurance-covered sector.\n",
      "11.14       A third advantage of the reform is that it is\n",
      "administratively easier to manage. The public pension is simpler to\n",
      "administer for two reasons. Pensions would be calculated on the basis\n",
      "of wages up to a specified maximum. The distinction between basic and\n",
      "variable wages would be eliminated. If transfers between the public\n",
      "pension system and the Egyptian Treasury are halted, the financial\n",
      "position of the social insurance system would also be far easier to\n",
      "understand and manage, and would be put on a sounder basis if the\n",
      "reserves were to earn market rates of interest.\n",
      "11.15       Fourth, the private funding of erd-of-service liabilities\n",
      "and the development of a large private pension system can contribute to\n",
      "the maturation of an efficient private capital market. The reserves of\n",
      "the present social insurance system are largely invested in the NIB,\n",
      "where a few public officials aze responsible for allocating investment\n",
      "funds across projects. The projects in which they have invested have\n",
      "historically yielded negative returrs to the social insuran_e funds,\n",
      "implying that many of the projects would not pass a market test. In the\n",
      "reformed system, a much higher percentage of pension reserves would be\n",
      "held in or managed by private insurance funds. Managers of these funds\n",
      "would be forced to seek out investment opportunities with good returns.\n",
      "If they failed to find good investment opportunities, covered workers\n",
      "would seek to aove their accounts to pension funds where returns were\n",
      "higher.\n",
      "11.16       The reserves of the SIS would be invested through private\n",
      "insurance funds and in public debt instruments that earn market rates of\n",
      "return. The public pension system must also hold precautionary reser-zes\n",
      "in order to maintain a buffer against unexpected economic events, such\n",
      "as recession -- which can sharply reduce contributions -- and inflation\n",
      "-- which can raise the system's liabilities to current pensioners.\n",

      "These reserves must be invested in tradable and secure assets, primarily\n",

      "IV. The Reformed System\n",
      "11.17       Basigc ublic System.  The current public social insurance\n",
      "system consists of two elements, one that insures basic wages (wages\n",
      "below LE 250 p.m.) and a second that insures variable pensions (wages\n",
      "between LE 250 and LE 625 p.m.). The suggested reform package is\n",
      "intended to minimize transition problems from the old to the new system.\n",
      "The first component of the existing system, with some changes, could\n",
      "constitute the basic public program under a reformed system. The second\n",
      "component of the existing system should be abolished altogether and\n",
      "replaced with a compulsory private program. The present variable\n",
      "pension program fails to provide worker with pensions (retirement,\n",
      "survivors' and disability) that replace a meaningful or predictable\n",
      "percentage of lost earnings. For young workers who expect to work a\n",
      "full career in covered jobs, the system imposes high taxes for very\n",
      "small and uncertain future benefits. The functions of the current\n",
      "variable pension system should be assumed by a new private pension\n",
      "system. The current distinction between basic and variable pensions\n",
      "should be eliminated. Both types of wages should be combined under a\n",
      "single definition. The reformed system should, instead, make a\n",
      "distinction between the public pensionable wage -- say, wages below\n",
      "LE 300 p.m. -- and the private pensionable wage -- the amount of the\n",
      "total wage in excess of LE 300 p.m. (This benchmark wage should be\n",
      "indexed.) Without additional information about the distribution of\n",
      "wages in Egypt, it is impossible to make an exact determination of the\n",
      "best level of the maximum public pensionable wage (see below).\n",
      "11.18       Redistribution between highly paid and poorly paid workers\n",
      "must take place within the basic public social insurance system. The\n",
      "principal goals of the system should be to provide dependable basic\n",
      "pensions to all covered workers and to minimize the extent of poverty\n",
      "among families of retired, disabled or deceased workers who have served\n",
      "full careers in covered employment. A dependable pension can be offered\n",
      "if the basic pension formula makes explicit allowance for wage and price\n",
      "inflation. The promised pension should replace a predictable percentage\n",
      "of a worker's average real earnings after a full career in covered\n",
      "employment.\n",
      "11.19       The current pension formula provides a reasonable, though\n",
      "perhaps overgenerous, formula for computing basic pensions when there is\n",
      "no inflation. The worker's replacement rate rises by slightly more than\n",
      "2 percent for each year of creditable service in covered employment,\n",
      "with a maximum allowable replacement rate of 80 percent. This basic\n",
      "formula can be retained. However, the reference wage should be changed.\n",
      "The present reference wage is the unindexed average wage during the\n",
      "worker's last two years in covered employment. This should be modified\n",
