Known for their economic success and dynamism, countries in the East Asia and Paciﬁc region
must tackle an increasingly complex set of challenges to continue on a path of sustainable devel-
opment. Learning from others within the region and beyond can help identify what works, what
doesn’t, and why, in the search for practical solutions to these challenges. This regional ﬂagship
series presents analyses of issues relevant to the region, drawing on the global knowledge and
experience of the World Bank and its partners. The series aims to inform public discussion, policy
formulation, and development practitioners’ actions to turn challenges into opportunities.

 BOX 1.1                  Uncertainty and assumptions in United Nations population data

     The population data used in this chapter, which are                            tion of fertility rates, which range from low to high
     drawn from the 2012 revision of the United Nations                             fertility. It makes additional assumptions in a sixth
     (UN) World Population Prospects, involve important                             scenario that projects population with constant mor-
     uncertainties and assumptions that affect long-term                            tality rates, and in a seventh scenario that projects
     projections (UN 2013). First, historical fertility and                         population with no migration. An eighth scenario
     life expectancy rates are estimated with significant                           projects population holding fertility and mortality
     error rates, introducing imprecision into current                              constant. Although the UN invests significant effort

     should be used with caution. Especially for devel-                             can be considerably inaccurate. This can be seen for
     oping countries, the UN draws from a variety of                                selected East Asian and Pacific countries in figure

The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental
footprint. In support of this commitment, the Publishing and Knowl-
edge Division leverages electronic publishing options and print-on-
demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide.
Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping
distances decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical
use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.
   The Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended
standards for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. The majority
of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified
paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content. The
recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using
totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine-free (PCF), or enhanced
elemental chlorine-free (EECF) processes.
