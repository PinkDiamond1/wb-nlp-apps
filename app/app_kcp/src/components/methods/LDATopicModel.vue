        Topic models are a class of unsupervised machine learning models that
        attempt to learn topics from a collection of documents. One of the most
        popular topic modeling algorithms is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
        (LDA). The LDA uses only the words and their frequency in documents as
        input. Different optimization strategies may be used to train the model
        depending on the variant of the LDA. The models used in this work employ
        Gibs sampling (Mallet) and variational bayes algorithm (Gensim).

        We used the implementation of the LDA from Gensim and Mallet. Our
        initial tests suggested that, while the topic model itself has
        parameters that can be tuned, maximizing the quality of the input data
        is more impactful in having robust and interpretable topic models. We
        set up a pipeline of text processing specific for the data that was used
        to train the topic models. This was made possible by the composable text

        that we have developed.
      </p>

        We found that limiting the words based on part-of-speech improves the
        interpretability of the resulting topics. The part-of-speech of words
        that were included was limited to nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. While
        we generally considered adverbs as acceptable words, some of the more
        common and less informative adverbs were added into our stop words list
        such as typically, usually, likely, etc.

        Despite the cleaning, some topics learned by the models were still found
        to be non-informative or irrelevant. This is one of the pitfalls of
        unsupervised models, i.e., we canâ€™t predict a priori how or what topics
        will be captured; nonetheless, most of the topics that we captured are
        relevant. To address this, we analyzed the topics learned by the models
        and tagged which ones are to be excluded.
