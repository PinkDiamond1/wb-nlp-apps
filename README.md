> A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file was generated inside your project but in order to make sure the hooks will run, please don't forget to install the `pre-commit` package:

    $ cd wb_nlp
    $ # it is a good idea to create and activate a virtualenv here
    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install
    $ # another good idea is update the hooks to the latest version
